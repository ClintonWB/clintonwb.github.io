How to delete or update your Math Dept MathSciNet publications list
on your WWWbio page
</H3>

<P>
The publication list on your Math WWWbio page might be seriously
out of date.

<P>
That publication list was created some years ago by a
well intentioned person. If you haven't updated it, it has stayed
the same as the day it was created. I explain here how to
update it or remove it.

<P>
If you keep your vita and publication list posted on your
personal web page at

<P>
www.math.purdue.edu/~yourloginID

<P>
then you might not want another version on your official
WWWbio page. You can get rid of it by following the steps
I am about to give you. (These steps will remove a file called
<B>index</B> in your

<P>
<PRE>
~/WWWbio/Publications
</PRE>

directory, and then remove the <B>Publications</B> directory too.)

<P>
In a UNIX terminal window on our SUN network, type the
following commands:

<P>
<PRE>
cd
cd WWWbio
cd Publications
rm index
rm *
</PRE>

<P>
You might have to answer "y" for yes to
make those removals happen. Now <B>index</B> is gone
along with any other files that might be sitting
around that directory. (The rm&nbsp;* was to remove
ALL the files from that directory.)

<P>
Next, you will remove the <B>Publications</B>
directory too. (If you don't do this, there will
be a non-functioning link to your publication list
on your WWWbio page.)

<P>
<PRE>
cd
cd WWWbio
rmdir Publications
</PRE>

<P>
If you would rather update the list, it can be done
in a fairly automated fashion. Here's how.

<P>
Go to the MathSciNet search page at

<P>
<A HREF="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/">http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/</A>

<P>
and search for your publications. (Once you find yourself listed
on something that is definitely your publication, click on your
name there. In my case, that gets rid of the papers on the list
by other people with my name.)

<P>
Next, select <B>Citations (BibTeX)</B> in the Batch Download
drop down menu box (near the upper lefthand corner) and click on

<P>
<B>Retrieve First 50</B>

<P>
Now you should should see at most 50 of your publications
in BibTeX reference format. If you have more than 50
publications, scroll down to the bottom and click on

<P>
<B>Show all results</B>

<P>
Now all your papers should be there. Next, you need to
copy all that text to a file. I selected the text starting
from the top and dragged my mouse down to the bottom of the
screen so it would scroll and select all the way to the
bottom. When all the text was selected, I typed control-c
for copy. Then I dumped the text into a file named

<P>
papers.bib

<P>
that I put in my ~/WWWbio/Publications directory.

<P>
Next, you will need a command on our system at

<P>
<PRE>
/pkgs/bibtex2html/bin/bibtex2html
</PRE>

<P>
In my ~/WWWbio/Publications directory where I put <B>papers.bib</B>
I typed

<P>
<PRE>
/pkgs/bibtex2html/bin/bibtex2html papers.bib
</PRE>

<P>
You can copy and paste that command from here
to avoid typing all that. (If you update often,
you can add this command to your path so you
can type only bibtex2html to call it, or you
can make an alias for the command.)

<P>
Now when you list that directory, you will see new
files <B>papers.html</B> and <B>papers_bib.html</B>.
Move the first file to a file named

<P>
<PRE>
~/WWWbio/Publications/index
</PRE>

<P>
and move the second file to your directory

<P>
<PRE>
~/WWWbio/
</PRE>

<P>
That second file should have name

<P>
<PRE>
~/WWWbio/papers_bib.html
</PRE>

<P>
Make both files readable to user, others, and group. You'll
probably need to manually fix some minor things in the

<P>
<PRE>
~/WWWbio/Publications/index
</PRE>

<P>
file. (For example, none of my C-infinities or d-bars in TeX
came out in HTML, so I had to go in and put them in as words.)

<P>
That's all there is to it!

<P>
P.S. If you'd like to accomplish some of these things on a Windows
machine, you can find free reference management sofware called
<B>JabRef</B> on the web. Check out the Wikipedia article about it,
for example. There are also web sites out there that will convert
BibTeX to HTML for you. Let me know if you come up with a better
way to do these things.
