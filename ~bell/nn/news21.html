I came, I saw, ical
</H1>

<P>
There's a great new calendar and appointment book program on our
system called <tt>ical</tt> at

<P>
<tt>
/pkgs/tcl/bin/ical
</tt>

<P>
You can try it out by typing

<P>
<tt>/pkgs/tcl/bin/ical   &</tt>

<P>
at a prompt in an xterm.  (The ampersand "&" puts the ical job
in the "background" so you can continue to use your xterm window
for something else if you want to.)

<P>
The ical program is easily customized and virtually self explanatory.
One feature I really like is that it will beep me and flash a reminder
at me any number of times before an appointment.  Click on OPTIONS and
choose DEFAULT ALARMS to set the number and intervals of the reminders.

<P>
Another feature that is nice is that when you select PRINT from
the FILE menu, the program will print the currently displayed month
as a standard calendar page sideways to fill a regular sheet of paper
with as many of your appointments squeezed into each day as will fit.

<P>
If you like ical, you'll want to create something easier to type
to start it up.  First, type

<P>
<tt>
which ical
</tt>

<P>
to verify that the <tt>ical</tt> command is not in your path.
(If it turns out to be in your path, you can just type <tt>ical</tt>
to fire it up.)

<P>
If ical is not in your path, you can do one of the following two
things.  You could put it in your path by making the relevant
lines in your <tt>.cshrc</tt> file look something like this:

<P>
<PRE>
# Add personal binary directories to the search path.  For security,
# "." should go at the end (if at all).

set path = ( ~/bin $path /pkgs/tcl/bin . )
</PRE>

<P>
NOTE:  You'll need to log off and log back on again for changes
in your .cshrc file to take hold.

<P>
Another way to simplify your life would be to make an "alias" in
your <tt>.cshrc</tt> file for the hard to type command.  You could
add the line

<P>
<tt>
alias appoints '/pkgs/tcl/bin/ical   &'
</tt>

<P>
at the end of your <tt>.cshrc</tt> file.  Then you could just type

<P>
<tt>
appoints
</tt>

<P>
at an xterm prompt to start up <tt>ical</tt>.

<P>
In case <tt>ical</tt> is more calendar power than you need, I
mention here that UNIX hounds know that you can type

<P>
<tt>
cal
</tt>

<P>
to see a calendar of this month, and

<P>
<tt>
cal 2001
</tt>

<P>
to see the whole calendar for the year of 2001, and

<P>
<tt>
cal 3 2025
</tt>

<P>
to see what day your birthday in March will be on in the year 2025.

<P>
Also there is a dorky little program called <tt>xcalendar</tt>
at

<P>
<tt>
/opt/local/X11/xcalendar
</tt>

<P>
that might satisfy your needs.

<H2>
ADDENDUM 5/10/2002
</H2>

<P>
You can find a very nice calendar program called <tt>gnomecal</tt>
at

<P>
<tt>
/opt/gnome-1.4/bin/gnomecal
</tt>

<P>
It works very much like the ical program above, but it has the
nice feature that appointments appear on the month view of the
calendar, and they look especially nice when you make it go full
screen.  (However, it does not have a print command, which can
be irritating.)

<P>
You can put the <tt>gnomecal</tt> command in your path by making
the relevant lines in your <tt>.cshrc</tt> file look like this:

<P>
<PRE>
# Add personal binary directories to the search path.  For security,
# "." should go at the end (if at all).

set path = ( ~/bin $path /opt/gnome-1.4/bin . )
</PRE>

<P>
NOTE:  You'll need to log off and log back on again for changes
in your .cshrc file to take hold.

<P>
After this, you can just type <tt>gnomecal</tt> at a prompt to
fire up the calendar.
