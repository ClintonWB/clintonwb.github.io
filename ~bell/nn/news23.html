How to view e-mail formatted in HTML originating from the web
</H1>

<P>
<HR>

Click on <B>RELOAD</B> now.  This page is frequently updated and
you might be looking at an old version saved by your netscape cache.

<P>
<HR>

<P>
If you stick with an old mail system like pine, elm, or
just plain old mail, you will be annoyed more and more by
e-mail that comes to you in the unviewable hypertext mark-up
language HTML.  I explain here how you can view this stuff.

<P>
First, start up Netscape by typing something like

<P>
<tt>
netscape -install &
</tt>

<P>
(You don't have to have the -install option, but it keeps netscape
from using up all the colors and you can start other things like xdvi
without running out of colors.)

<P>
Next, you will start up something called Netscape Mail.
Pull down the "Communicator" menu at the top of the
Netscape window and select "Messenger."  If you are doing
this for the first time, Netscape will create a directory
in your Home directory called <tt>nsmail</tt> containing
the following files:

<P>
<PRE>
Drafts            Sent              Trash
Inbox             Templates         Unsent Messages
</PRE>

<P>
When you select Messenger, a window will pop up that does
e-mail in Netscape.  You will probably need to resize it
to make it usable.  I make mine go full screen.

<P>
<HR>

<P>
<H1>
WARNING!
</H1>

<P>
If, like David Drasin, you keep hundreds of old messages
in your mail box, be very careful not to click on the
"Get Msg" icon or to select "Get New Messages" from the FILE
menu in Netscape Mail.  If you do this, all the messages
stored in your mail box will get moved over to your Inbox
in Netscape mail (which is your new file <tt>Inbox</tt> in your new
directory <tt>nsmail</tt>), and next time you use your
regular e-mail program, it will look like all your old
messages are gone.  They are not gone, they are moved.
If you want to view your old messages in your old e-mail
program, just open <tt>~/nsmail/Inbox</tt> as a folder.
You can also copy the file ~/nsmail/Inbox to a mail folder
with a name like <tt>old_mail</tt> in the directory where
your mail program keeps its folders (the <tt>Mail</tt>
directory in elm, for example).  This might force you to
make an appropriate change in life style.

<P>
If you make this mistake and you want your messages moved
back, just e-mail <tt>systems@math</tt> and ask them to cat
your file <tt>~/nsmail/Inbox</tt> back to the end of your
file <tt>/usr/mail/your_login_id_here</tt>.  They'll
know what you did.  You don't have to explain.

<P>
Note:  The tilde in <tt>~/nsmail/Inbox</tt> is UNIX shorthand
for the name of your home directory.  In my case, it is
short for <tt>/u/u9/bell</tt>.

<P>
After you finish reading this page, you might want to read what
Rodrigo Ba&ntilde;uelos has to say about

<P>
<A HREF="./Pop/pop.html">How to change your Netscape Mail Preferences
</A> so that your mail box does not get moved to your Netscape Inbox.

<P>
<HR>

<P>
Next, pull down the FILE menu in Netscape Messenger and
select "New Subfolder."  In the little window that pops
up, type a name like <tt>transfer</tt>.  This will create
a new mail folder in your nsmail directory called transfer.

<P>
Ok, now we are ready to go.  Let's say you just got an e-mail
in elm that is HTML gobbledygook and you want to view it.
Move down to the message on the list in elm that you want
to look at and type

<P>
<tt>
s   ~/nsmail/transfer
</tt>

<P>
This will save the message to the "transfer" folder in
Netscape Mail.  Now go back to Netscape Messenger and
click on the folder "transfer."  (If you don't see it,
you might need to click on the little box with the plus
sign in it next to the "Local Mail" icon in the left hand
column on the screen.)  After you click on the "transfer"
folder, you will see a message list in the box in the
upper right of the window.  Scroll down to the bottom
and click on the message you just moved to view it.  It
will appear in the box below the list in the lower right.
(If you haven't resized your window to full screen, you
will wish you had at this point.  It is not too late.)

<P>
After you determine that what you have is junk mail,
click on the Delete icon in the task bar at the top of
the window.  To get out of Netscape Mail, just select
"Close" from the FILE menu.  (If you select "Exit"
you will also close your Netscape Navigator window.)

<P>
If you get comfortable using Netscape Mail, you will
discover that it is quite good at displaying attachments
of various kinds (PDF files, PostScript files, images in
JPEG or GIF format, DVI files, etc.).  You can usually
click on an attachment to have it pop up in the appropriate
viewer where you can select PRINT from the FILE menu
to print it.  The attachments appear at the bottom of
the e-mail as links that you can click on.  You can
also click on the "paper clip" icon to toggle the showing of
the attachment viewing box at the bottom of the screen.  In
that case the attachments appear as icons that you can
click on.

<P>

<P>
If you only want to view an e-mail that comes in HTML once
or rarely, you might try the following method to avoid all the
hassle above.

<P>
First, I save the offending message to a file with a <tt>.html</tt>
extension.  For example, in elm, I would move down to the message
in the list I want to view and type something like

<P>
<tt>
s  junkmail.html
</tt>

<P>
to save the message in a file called <tt>junkmail.html</tt>.

<P>
Next, I would edit the file <tt>junkmail.html</tt> to remove
the mail header text.  (This might not be necessary if the mail
came as an attachment and you were prompted to save it as a
file.)

<P>
Finally, I would go to the directory where <tt>junkmail.html</tt>
resides and type

<P>
<tt>
netscape junkmail.html &
</tt>

<P>
and, if you are lucky, <I>voila</I>, there you see it!  (Don't
forget to delete it.)  If you don't see it, or if it is garbled,
you will need to use the harder method I described above.
