Vanilla beamer for baby boomers by example
</H1>

<P>
Never do I feel my age so much as when a young colleague
gives a high tech math lecture using <tt>beamer</tt>.
(If you want to look my age, go up after such a talk
and ask the speaker, "Say, how did you ever create
such a snazzy math talk in PowerPoint?")

<P>
Instead of dying my hair with Grecian Formula (which
can actually turn grey hair a greenish color), I
decided to learn beamer.

<P>
I'll give some beamer examples here that might be
all you need to know to look and feel 20 years younger.

<P>
First, check out the following PDF file of the finished product.
Follow the link, then click on the screen and use the arrow keys
to page through the presentation.  (Or save the PDF to your
machine and view it in Adobe Acrobat or acroread there.  That
way you won't have the browser menus at the top.)

<P>
<A HREF="./beamer/lecture.pdf">lecture.pdf</A>

<P>
Note that several pages in the PDF file correspond to one slide
with overlays.  As you page through the PDF, the overlays
appear to pile on.

<P>
Here is the TeX source file that created that presentation.
Click on the link to view the source.  Save the text file as a
file named <tt>lecture.tex</tt> (and not as <tt>lecture.</tt><b>txt</b>).


<P>
<A HREF="./beamer/lecture.txt">lecture.tex</A>

<P>
You should be able to look at this vanilla source file and
easily figure out how to modify it in order to make your own
presentation.

<P>
To convert the <tt>lecture.tex</tt> source file to the PDF
document, just type

<P>
<PRE>
pdflatex lecture
</PRE>

<P>
at a UNIX prompt on the Math system.  This command will
create the file <tt>lecture.pdf</tt> which you can view in
Adobe Acrobat or acroread.

<P>
If you use Grecian Formula on your hair, you might also
like to try the Berkeley theme.  Just add these lines
near the top of the TeX source file.

<P>
<PRE>
\usepackage{beamerthemesplit}
\usetheme{Berkeley}
\usecolortheme{dolphin}
</PRE>

<P>
The next example uses a little bit more LaTeX and
shows how to do some more sophisticated things,
including how to apply the Berkeley theme.

<LI>Berkeley theme <A HREF="./beamer/b.pdf">lecture.pdf</A>

<P>
I learned most of what I know from these two sites:

<P>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="http://tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb26-1/mertz.pdf">Beamer by example, TUG-boat 26(1)</A>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/beamer/doc/beameruserguide.pdf">
The 224 page beamer users guide</A>
</UL>

<P>
You can find out at that first site how to put figures in
a beamer presentation.

<P>
...I remember when we used to carry in a wet towel to clean off
the board and dip our chalk in vinegar to give our talks that bold
and definitive look...
