How to improve visibility of fonts on older, smaller monitors

I would like to suggest the following changes that you can make to your
account to make life easier using a 17" monitor with Sun computers.
Basically, they get around the fact that letters will be small with a
small monitor.  In the following "click" means "left click".

<P>

I suggest you make the fonts bigger in Netscape.  In Netscape, under
the "Edit" menu at the top, open Preferences (the last item).  Click on
the triangle next to Appearance in the left menu so it is pointing down,
and click on Fonts.

<P>
On the right of the line "Variable Width Font" set the Size default to
18.0 (I'm presuming the font is still set to "Times (Adobe)".)

<P>
On the right of the line "Fixed Width Font", set the size to 14.0.
(I'm assuming the font is set to "Courier (Adobe)".)

<P>
I also suggest you change the default background color from grey to white.

<P>
To do this, with the Preferences window open, click on "Colors" on the
left menu.  Click on the colored square next to the word "Background"
You will get a rectangular array of colors.  Click on the white color
and click "OK".

<P>
Then click "OK" on the Netscape preferences window.

<P>
<LI>
I suggest you change the color of the Xterm windows to have black
letters on a white background.  To do this, edit the file .Xdefaults in
your home directory. (E.g., say "vi .Xdefaults".)  You may have lines like

<P>
<PRE>
XTerm*foreground:      bisque
XTerm*background:      dodgerblue4
</PRE>

<P>
Put an exclamation point at the start of each line to comment them
out, so it looks like

<P>
<PRE>
!XTerm*foreground:      bisque
!XTerm*background:      dodgerblue4
</PRE>

<P>
and add the lines

<P>
<PRE>
XTerm*foreground:      black
XTerm*background:      white
</PRE>

<P>
I also suggest you change the default font in xterms to be bigger.
If you have a line

<P>
<PRE>
XTerm*VT100*font: lucidasanstypewriter-bold-14
</PRE>

<P>
I suggest you change it to

<P>
<PRE>
XTerm*VT100*font: lucidasanstypewriter-bold-16
</PRE>
</OL>

<P>
Note: You can always make the font in an individual xterm larger
or smaller by moving the mouse pointer into the window, holding
down the CONTROL key, and then holding down the right mouse button.
Slide the mouse pointer down to your font size choice and let go
when you get there.  The choices are

<P>
<PRE>
Default
Unreadable
Tiny
Small
Medium
Large
Huge

Thanks to Meike Niederhausen for helping me with a survey of the
departmental computer labs and trying several things on her account.
