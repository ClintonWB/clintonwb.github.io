The new TeX and how to create the new PU Math letterhead stationery

How to create Math Letterhead in AMS-TeX and (plain) TeX
</H3>

<P>
I give three different ways to create Math Letterhead in this volume
of the News.  I like the first way best.  At the moment, you need to
have

<P>
<tt>
/pkgs/texlive-2007/bin
</tt>

<P>
early in your path in order to use the new TeX and the new letterhead
macros that Brad Lucier created to go with it.  If you don't
know how to do this, click on
<A HREF="./path.html">your&nbsp;path</A> to find out how.

<P>
Now check out

<P>
<TT>
<A HREF="./sample1_tex.txt">sample.tex</A>
</TT>

<P>
to see a sample letter.  Save this text file as <tt>sample.tex</tt>
and use it as a template for your own letters.  Type

<P>
<tt>
amstex sample.tex
</tt>

<P>
to TeX the file, and after that, type

<P>
<tt>
xdvi sample.dvi
</tt>

<P>
to see it, and

<P>
<tt>
dvips sample.dvi
</tt>

<P>
to print it.

<P>
By default, this creates a black-and-white version of the  
Purdue logo.  If you use a color printer and want to have
a black-and-gold version of the logo, add

<P>
<tt>
\goldlogo
</tt>

<P>
to your TeX file just after the

<P>
<PRE>
\input mathletter2006
</PRE>

<P>
line.

<P>
You can find some other sample files in the directory

<P>
<tt>
/pkgs/texlive-2007/texmf-local/tex/plain/local/
</tt>

<P>
The new <tt>dvips</tt> command that comes with the new TeX
is slightly different than our old version.  For example, I
used to refer to certain input files by their full path
name.  I referred to my signature file as

<P>
<tt>/homes/bell/Images/signature.eps</tt>

<P>
and <tt>dvips</tt> would find it and put it where I told it
to.  It won't do this anymore (for security reasons).  You'll
need to put all your special input files in a directory and
add that directory to a TEXINPUTS environemental variable
in your .cshrc file.  To solve this problem for myself, I
created a directory called <tt>Mytexfiles</tt> in my home
directory and moved all my special input files there.  Then
I added the line

<P>
<tt>setenv TEXINPUTS $HOME/Mytexfiles//:</tt>

<P>
to my .cshrc file.  (That funny //: thing at the end of the line
needs to be there.  See a message from our own
<A HREF="./chap.txt">Chapman&nbsp;Flack</A> for the reason why.)
Now, when I refer to the input file in any directory where I'm doing
TeX, I merely call it <tt>signature.eps</tt> and TeX and dvips
search for it in my Mytexfiles directory and find it.

<P>
This might be a good place to mention that Robert McGraw told
me about a small program called <tt>Xming</tt>
that is useful for people like me who only use an X-server on my
PC at home to tunnel xdvi output through an ssh session.  (It is
much easier and smaller than the gigantic Cygwin or PC X-ware
programs.)  Check out this
<A HREF="http://gears.aset.psu.edu/hpc/guides/xming/">
instructional&nbsp;site</A> at Penn State
for links to download Xming and a nice explanation of how to
use it to tunnel X-connections through your secure shell program.

How to create Math Letterhead in LaTeX
</H3>

<P>
A few years ago, Rodrigo Ba&ntilde;uelos took Adam Hammer's CS LaTeX
letterhead and modified it for Math Department use.  Brad Lucier has
added a slightly modified version of these files to the department's
TeX installation at

<P>
<tt>
/pkgs/texlive-2007/texmf-local/tex/latex/local
</tt>

<P>
Check out

<P>
<TT>
<A HREF="./sample2_tex.txt">sample.tex</A>
</TT>

<P>
to see a sample letter that uses this new macro.  Save this text
file as <tt>sample2.tex</tt> and use it as a template for your own
letters.  Run

<P>
<tt>
latex sample2.tex
</tt>

<P>
twice to TeX the file, and after that use xdvi and dvips as above to
view and print the file.

<P>
To get a color Purdue logo, just
uncomment out the "\ColorLogo" line in
the file </tt>sample2.tex</tt>

<P>
Rodrigo Ba&ntilde;uelos points out that
if you have an electronic signature, <tt>signature.eps</tt> (for latex) or a  
<tt>signature.pdf</tt> (for pdflatex), you can also paste it in the letter (which
is very useful  for uploading letters to <tt>mathjobs.org</tt>.)  He explains that
to do this, replace the line

<P>
<PRE>
\signature{blah-blah,\\ Professor of blah-blah}
</PRE>

<P>
by

<P>
<PRE>
\signature{\vskip-.6in{\hskip-.2in\scalebox{.4}{\includegraphics
{singature.pdf}}}\\ blah-blah,\\ Professor of blah-blah}
</PRE>

<P>
for pdflatex

<P>
or

<P>
<PRE>
\signature{\vskip-.6in{\hskip-.2in\scalebox{.4}{\includegraphics
{singature.eps}}}\\ blah-blah,\\ Professor of blah}
</PRE>

<P>
for latex.

<P>
Note:  You may need to play around with the number in <tt>\scalebox{.x}</tt>
and some of the other parameters given here to get size and location of
your signature to your liking.

A very simple and elegant LaTeX solution to the Purdue letterhead problem
that only a true mathematician could be so bold to create has been given by
our own J.-K. Yu.  Copy the two files below to the directory where you do TeX.

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Click on <A HREF="./Yu/letter_tex.txt">letter.tex.txt</A>
and save it as <tt>letter.tex</tt>
<LI>Click on <A HREF="./Yu/purduelh_sty.txt">purduelh.sty.txt</A>
and save it as <tt>purduelh.sty</tt>
</UL>

<P>
Edit <tt>letter.tex</tt> and substitute your own information in the
obvious places.  Latex the file and, as above, use xdvi to view it
and dvips to print it.  The beauty of the thing is that there is no
graphics file to deal with for the logo.  Yu created the logo using
LaTeX fonts, lines, and even colors.  You get a color logo by default,
but if you comment out the

<P>
<tt>\colorlh</tt>

<P>
line by putting a percent sign in front of it, you'll get a black and
white logo.
