Adding the Math Seminar calendar to your google calendar
</H1>

<P>
<I>...with thanks to Kelly Beranger</I>

<P>
You can use the Google Math Seminar Calendar to send you a schedule of
Seminars every day at 5 am using Google Calendar's Agenda
Notifications function. You can also have the Math Seminar Calendar
displayed on your personal google calendar.

<P>
I first set up a google account using my Purdue address so I could
receive these e-mails to my purdue account. If you want to use your
already existing google account you may skip the first two steps.


<P>
1. Cut and paste the following link to set up your account.
https://accounts.google.com/SignUpWithoutGmail (Note at the bottom you
MUST agree to the terms of service and privacy policy, but you DO NOT
have to agree to allow google to use your account information to
personalize your +'s and ads on non-google websites.  You also do not
have to provide a mobile phone number, which they use to help reset
passwords.)

<P>
2.  You will receive an e-mail asking your to confirm your account.  Do
so.

<P>
3. Once your account is set up and you've signed in via your browser
you can go https://www.math.purdue.edu/calendar/seminars and click on
the + Google Calendar icon on the bottom right of the seminar calendar

<P>
4. Since you are already signed into Google it will go to your calendar
page and ask you if you want to add the Mathematics Seminars calendars.
Click Yes, add this calendar.  Google will add this calendar in your
Other Calendars list.

<P>
5. On your Google Calendar page on the right hand side of the page
there is an icon that looks like a gear.  Click that to see a drop-down
menu.
Select Settings.

<P>
6. In settings select Calendars on the left hand side to see the
Calendars settings.

<P>
7. Under Other Calendars find the Mathematics Seminars calendar.  For
this calendar you can adjust NOTIFICATIONS by clicking on Reminders and
notifications.

<P>
8.  Click on the Email box under Daily agenda.  Then click on the save
button.  This button can be found on the top and bottom on the left
hand side of the page.

<P>
Once you set up e-mail notifications you'll receive an e-mail from
Google Calendar with an agenda list of seminars that looks like the
attached screen shot.  This e-mail goes out at ~5 am in whatever
timezone your calendar is set for.  To check what your Time Zone
settings are go to the Gear icon on your Google Calendar, select
Settings, then under General check what Your current time zone is set
for. Mine is set for (GMT -05:00) Eastern Time.
