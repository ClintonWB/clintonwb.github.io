<B>amsppt</B> note:

<P>
If you have tried to use the <B>amsppt</B> style file with
our new amstex package (at /usr/local/teTeX/bin/sparc-sunos4.1.3_U1
on SUNOS or  /opt/teTeX/bin/sparc-solaris2.5.1 on SOLARIS),
and if you use \magnification=\magstep1, then you have probably
found that some pages print off the bottom of the paper.  AMS Tech
Support says to fix this problem by adding the line

<P>
<tt>
\voffset-3pc
</tt>

<P>
after the \documentstyle{amsppt} line.
