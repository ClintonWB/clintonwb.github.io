How to share sensitive Purdue files with authorized Purdue people via
</H1>

<PRE>
https://filelocker.purdue.edu/
</PRE>

<P>
Let's say I have a file called

<PRE>
classlist.csv
</PRE>

<P>
that I want to share with my TA so she can create a grade sheet
for the class we teach together.  It is against the rules to
e-mail such a file and it is against the rules to store the file
on anything but a secure Purdue server.  To get the file to my
TA, I would use ItaP's <B>filelocker</B> service as follows.

<P>
First, I would log onto one of the Math Departments SUNs like
banach and open a browser there.  Then I would go to

<PRE>
https://filelocker.purdue.edu/
</PRE>

<P>
and logon there with my Purdue Career Account login and password.

<P>
Next, I would click on the Upload button and navigate to the
file I want to upload to upload it.

<P>
After the file appears in my file list, I would click on the
Share file button to create an e-mail notification to my TA
that the file is ready to be downloaded by her.  I need to
type in my TA's Purdue Career Account login ID to do this.
