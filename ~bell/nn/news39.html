How to personalize your bio page at MathSciNet
</H1>

<P>
If you are logged on to a computer with MathSciNet access,
you can check out this example of a

<P>
<A HREF="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/search/author.html?mrauthid=179025">
MathSciNet bio page</A>

<P>
to see an improved bio page with a picture and
and e-mail address added. (A link to personal
home pages can also be added.)

<P>
To create such a page for yourself, go to the

<P>
<A HREF="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/index.html?version=2">
MathSciNet Author lookup page</A>

<P>
(from a Purdue IP address) and type your name in the box as

<P>
<B>Lastname,&nbsp;Firstname</B>

<P>
and click Submit. If there is more than one of you out there
(like there is with me), find yourself and select yourself
(by sliding down to Author Profile and clicking). Your rather
bare Author Bio page should load. Now click on the blue
<B>Edit Author Profile</B> box in the upper right and log on
using your AMS login credentials. The rest is easy!

<P>
If you are pleased with what you create and you don't mind your
citation index showing in public, you can link to it
from your home page to make it easy for people to find your
publications on MathSciNet. Just copy the URL from the browser
box when you visit your bio. It will look something like this:

<P>
<TT>
http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/search/author.html?mrauthid=179025
</TT>

<P>
Note: People who click on this link will only be able to see
your MathSciNet bio page if they have online access to MathSciNet.
I explain in <A HREF="./news36.html">Volume&nbsp;36</A> how to
copy your MathSciNet publication list to your math home page.

<P>
If you go to your MathSciNet bio page and click on
<B>Publications</B>, it will take you to a URL that looks
like this:

<P>
<TT>
http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/search/publications.html?pg1=INDI&s1=179025
</TT>

<P>
You can use the URL you see for your own papers as a link to
your publications that anyone with online MathSciNet access can
see. Only your papers show up that way with no mention of your
citation index or face.
