<P>
I explain here how to use the spreadsheet program
<tt>gnumeric</tt> on a MATH SUN.  It is very much like
<tt>excel</tt>.  In fact, it is so compatible with
excel that it can read and alter files created by excel
(with a .xls file extension).

<P>
First, logon to a MATH SUN, start X, and then type

<P>
<tt>
xon peano
</tt>

<P>
in an xterm.  An xterm running on the Solaris machine <tt>peano</tt>
will pop up.  (The <tt>gnumeric</tt> program is only available on
Solaris machines.  You can put the name of any Solaris machine in
place of peano.)

<P>
Next, type

<P>
<tt>
gnumeric &
</tt>

<P>
in the peano xterm window.  A spreadsheet window should appear
in a few seconds.

<P>
I will now give a step by step description of how I set up a grade
sheet for my MATH 262 class.  First, I entered the names of my 32 students
in Column A by clicking on cell A1 and then typing a name and then
pushing RETURN to automatically enter the name and move down to the
next cell, all the way down to A32.  Don't worry about squeezing the
names into the cells because after all the names are entered, you can
click on a box in the column of names and then click on the FORMAT menu
and choose COLUMNS and then WIDTH and type in a bigger number to increase
the column width (or easier yet, select AUTO FIT SELECTION).

<P>
Next, I entered the scores into the proper cells exactly as I did
the names above.

<P>
Next, I wanted the sum of the numbers in Columns B and C plus
the number in Column D divided by 50 plus the number in Column E
divided by 50 to go into Column F (rounded to an integer).  I
left mouse clicked in cell F1 and then typed

<P>
<tt>=int(.5+B1+C1+D1/50+E1/50)</tt>

<P>
and pushed RETURN.  The number I wanted, rounded to the nearest
integer appeared in cell F1.  To make similar numbers appear in
all the rest of the cells in Column F, I simply clicked in cell
F1 and selected COPY from the EDIT menu.  The I left mouse clicked
in cell F2 and dragged all the way down to the bottom row of Column
F to highlight the empty cells below F1 (i.e., F2-F32).  Then I
selected PASTE from the EDIT menu and <I>voila!</I> the numbers I
wanted appeared.

<P>
This might be a good moment to PRINT your worksheet.  In the
future, you might just select PRINT from the FILE menu and then click
on the PRINTER check box.  However, at the moment, printing is not set
up properly.  To get a hard copy of your grades, you can select SAVE AS
from the FILE menu and then select SIMPLE TEXT from the File Format menu
and type in a file name and then click on OK.  Then you can print
the text file via the lpr command.)

<P>
To sort the rows in the sheet into the order determined by the
grand total in Column F, first left mouse click in cell A1 and
drag down to the lower right corner of the area where you have
entered scores to highlight your entire work area.  For me, that
is cell F32.  Next, select SORT from the TOOLS menu and enter
<B>F</B> in the first <tt>Sort by COLUMN</tt> box.  The order of
the whole rows in the highlighted area will get changed with
respect to the numbers in Column F.  Next, click on the DESCENDING
radio button in the dialogue box so that the sort will be done
so that the highest score moves to row one and scores go down from
there.  Finally, click on OK at the bottom of the dialogue box.
You should get a sorted list based on the numbers in Column F
and it should be easy to set cut offs for grades.  (To put the
rows back in alphabetical order, just drag from A1 to the lower
right corner F32 to highlight the whole sheet and select SORT
from the TOOLS menu and change Column F to Column A and then
check the ASCENDING radio button and select OK.)

<P>
I also like to put the average scores at the bottom of each column.
To do this, I type AVERAGES in the last cell in Column A (that's A33
for me) and then I click on the cell in Column B to the right of it
(B33) and type something like

<P>
<PRE>
=int(.5 + sum(B1:B32)/32 )
</PRE>

<P>
When I push RETURN, I get the average score for my 32 students in
Column B in cell B33.  To make similar numbers appear in the bottom
row for all the columns, I can mouse click on cell B33 and select COPY
from the edit menu  and then mouse click and drag over all the cells
in row 33 from Column C to Column F to highlight them and select
PASTE from the EDIT.  The averages should appear in row 33.

<P>
To save your spreadsheet for future use, select SAVE AS from
the FILE menu and type a file name like <tt>math262.xml</tt>
in the dialogue box.  (Be sure that the File Format is <tt>Old
Gnumeric XML</tt> and not something else, like Simple Text.)
Next time you fire up gnumeric, select OPEN from the file menu
and double click on the file <tt>math262.xml</tt> to continue
working on your 262 grades.  (Or you can type

<P>
<tt>
gnumeric math262.xml &
</tt>

<p>
at a prompt in an xterm running on a Solaris machine).

<P>
It is also rather easy to IMPORT grades from a simple text file to
a gnumeric spreatsheet.  Check out the IMPORT command from the FILE
menu.

<P>
It is smart practice to SAVE and PRINT your gradesheet every
time you enter new scores.

<P>
NOTE:
Dropping the lowest score is rather easy; just use a
formula like

<P>
<PRE>
=sum(B1:J1) - min(B1:J1)
</PRE>

<p>
in the input box for cell K1 to compute the total score in
cells B1 to J1 minus the lowest score.  To drop the
TWO lowest scores in a row before computing a total, use

<P>
<PRE>
=sum(B1:J1) - small(B1:J1,1) - small(B1:J1,2)
</PRE>

<P>
(The function <tt>small(B1:J1,5)</tt> returns the fifth
smallest number in the cells from B1 to J1.)
