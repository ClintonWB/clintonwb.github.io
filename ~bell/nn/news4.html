There is a new program called <tt>gnumeric</tt> that is better.
See <A HREF="./news16">Volume 16</A> to learn about gnumeric.

(There is a UNIX spreadsheet on our system called <tt>vc</tt> but
it is dorky.  Type <tt>man vc</tt> to see more about it.)

<P>
UNIX lovers compute grades using awk, sed, and perl, but others
prefer to use a spreadsheet like Excel.  I explain here how to use the 
Excel-like spreadsheet <B>Xess3</B> which is available on omni.cc.purdue.edu
and how to have xess window output sent from omni.cc to the math dept
SUN workstation on your desk.

<P>
First, get yourself an account on omni.cc.purdue.edu by going
down to the PUCC office on the second floor of MATH and filling
out a little form.

<P>
I assume that you are sitting at the workstation on your desk
in your office and that you are using X-windows.

<P>
On your machine, type

<P>
<tt>xhost + omni.cc</tt>

<P>
Next, rlogin to omni.cc.purdue.edu from an xterm window on your
machine by typing

<P>
<tt>rlogin omni.cc</tt>

<P>
in the window.  At the omni.cc.purdue.edu% prompt, type

<P>
<tt>setenv DISPLAY yourmachine.math:0</tt>

<P>
where <tt>yourmachine</tt> is the name of the machine on your
desk.

<P>
Now when you type

<P>
<tt>xess &</tt>

<P>
at the omni.cc.purdue.edu% prompt, the xess window will appear on
the screen at your desk.  (By the way, xess on omni resides at
/usr/opt/bin/xess.)  You might also find that programs like
netscape and maple run faster and better on omni.cc than they do at the
box on your desk.  These programs can be run on omni and viewed
at your desk in exactly the same way.

<P>
If you are sitting at an X-termial connected to banach or cantor, you
can do a similar thing.  Click <A HREF="./xterminal.html">HERE</A> for
more information.  You can even run xess on omni from a PC in a PUCC lab
anywhere on campus.  See <A HREF="./xess.html">xess on omni from a PC</A>
for more info.

<P>
The online help that comes with xess is rather easy to use.  Just
click on HELP at the upper right corner of the window and select
INDEX.

<P>
By the way, the hardest thing to learn about xess in order to
be able to compute grades is syntax like this:

<P>
<tt>=@SUM(B1..E1)</tt>

<P>
<tt>=@INT(.5+@SUM(B1..E1))</tt>

<P>
<tt>=@INT(.5+B1+C1+D1/50+E1/50+F1)</tt>

<P>
and how to copy a formula like this to a whole column of cells
using the COPY command in the EDIT menu.  (My first guess turned
out to be correct -- see below.)

<P>
I will now give a step by step description of how I set up a grade
sheet for my MATH 262 class.  First, I entered the students' names
in column A by clicking on cell A1 and then typing a name and then
pushing the DOWN arrow on my keyboard (without pushing RETURN) to
automatically enter the name and move down to the next cell.  After
that I just typed in names followed by the down arrow.  Don't worry
about squeezing the names into the cells because after all the names
are entered, you can highlight the whole column of names by mousing
and dragging and then pull down the FORMAT menu and pull down the
COLUMN WIDTH submenu and then select SNAP WIDTH TO CONTENTS to enlarge
the cells to hold the names.

<P>
Next, I entered the scores into the proper cells using the arrow
keys (without pushing RETURN).

<P>
Finally, I wanted the sum of the numbers in columns B and C plus
the number in column D divided by 50 plus the number in column E
divided by 50 to go into column F (rounded to an integer).  I
went to cell F1 and entered

<P>
<tt>=@INT(.5+B1+C1+D1/50+E1/50)</tt>

<P>
and pushed RETURN.  Then I selected COPY FORMULAS from the COPY
submenu of the EDIT menu.  Then I mouse and dragged over the
cells F2 through F39 so that F2 through F39 were highlighted.  And
voila, when I released the mouse button, all the sums appeared in
column F.

<P>
To change the width of cells so that the sheet will print nicely,
you can highlight a large portion of the sheet by mousing and
dragging and then select FORMAT and go to the COLUMN WIDTHS
submenu of the COLUMN WIDTHS menu and experiment with numbers
in the little dialogue box.

<P>
To sort the rows in the sheet into the order determined by the
grand total in column F, select SORT from the tools menu.  Next,
type in A1..F39 in the the RANGE box so that the order of the whole
rows in the big box A1-F39 get changed with respect to the numbers
in column F.  Next, type F1..F39 in the KEY 1 box and click on
the DESCENDING check box.  Finally, select OK or APPLY at the
bottom of the dialogue box.  You should get a sorted list based
on the numbers in column F and it should be easy to set cut offs
for grades.  (To put the rows back in alphabetical order, just
change the F1..F39 in the KEY 1 box to A1..A39 and uncheck the
DESCENDING box and select OK.)

<P>
To save your spreadsheet for future use, select SAVE AS from
the FILE menu and type a file name in the dialogue box like
grades.xs3 (that .xs3 file extension seems to be important).

<P>
To save the sheet as a plain ASCII text file (for printing or
file transfer), select EXPORT from the FILE menu and select TEXT
from the FILE FORMAT menu and then type in a file name like
sheet.txt in the dialogue box.  Push return or click on OK to
make the transfer.

<P>
To print a fancy PostScript version of the worksheet, I select
PRINT AS from the xess File menu and select 
Printer Type: POSTSCRIPT and Destination: FILE from the Printer
Options.  I type in a file name like sheet.ps in the Selection
box and this saves my work as a PostScript file sheet.ps.  Then
I ftp the file sheet.ps to my math account using the commands

<P>
<tt>ftp ftp.math<br>
put sheet.ps</tt>

<P>
and print the PostScript file on a math dept printer via the command

<P>
<tt>lpr sheet.ps</tt>

<P>
You can also print directly from omni.cc to the printer called
<tt>mathil</tt> (which is in the basement of the MATH building)
using the command

<P>
<tt>lp -d mathil sheet.ps</tt>

<P>
If you have been keeping grades in a text file in which names
and grades are separated by white space (i.e., any combination
of tabs and spaces), you can easily read the file into a new
spreadsheet.  Ftp your text file to omni and call it something
like grades.txt.  Select IMPORT from the FILE menu in Xess and
type in grades.txt in the dialogue box.  Click on OK.  Your grades
should be read into the sheet so that each name or score lands
in the appropriate cell.
