I explain here how to use a simple command to transform the classlist
that Peter Cook sends you via e-mail into a list of names to put in a
file useful for keeping grades electronically.  For example, the lines

<P>
<PRE>
262  02 01  MC LOUGHLIN, ERIN M          4   CHE  3.0    999-99-9998
262  02 01  TSENG, PANG-TAT BILLY BOY    2   E    3.0    999-99-9999
</PRE>

<P>
will be transformed into the more useful

<P>
<PRE>
MC_LOUGHLIN,E.M.
TSENG,P.-T.B.B.
</PRE>

<P>
The command is called <tt>listdorker</tt> and I wrote it myself.  It
is a <I>perl</I> script.  To get a copy of the command, simply
shift-left mouse click on

<P>
<A HREF="./listdorker">listdorker</A>

<P>
and save the command in a file called "listdorker."  (Alternatively,
left mouse click on it and select SAVE AS from the FILE menu and save
the file as TEXT in a file called listdorker.)  Move the file
to the same directory where you keep the file that holds the classlist that
Peter Cook sent you.  (Be sure to strip the mail header and blank
lines from Peter Cook's list.)   Make your listdorker file executable
by typing

<P>
<PRE>
chmod u+x listdorker
</PRE>

<P>
Let's say that your copy of Peter Cook's list is called "classlist."
To use listdorker, simply type

<P>
<PRE>
listdorker classlist &gt; nameslist
</PRE>

<P>
This command will create the file "nameslist."  (If you want to
see what nameslist will look like without creating it, simply type

<P>
<PRE>
listdorker classlist
</PRE>

<P>
This will send the names list to the screen.)

<P>
Don't worry, your old classlist file will remain unchanged where you
left it.

<P>
The listdorker command is easy to modify for other uses.  Instructions
for how to do that are included in the listdorker file.

<P>

spreadsheet, see <A HREF="./news4.html">Network News, volume 4</A>.
