I'm writing a  guest column for the network news.
The topic is how to check or send email from
a home computer or a laptop and a modem
without actually telnetting to the
math department and logging in. This is something that I had
wondered about  because I wanted to avoid tying
up the phone line, as well as the possibility of getting disconnected
in midstream (which has happened more than once).
Last year,  I stumbled on a solution which has worked well for me,
and it should for you.

<p>
The first thing to do is to  set up a new email account at Purdue's Mail*Hub .
If you do not know know your <tt>ph</tt> login ID and password, you will
first need to fill out the information at the bottom of

<P>
<A href="http://directory.purdue.edu/MAIL-HUB/md/email.htm">
http://directory.purdue.edu/MAIL-HUB/md/email.htm</a>,

<P>
and then wait to receive your ID and password by campus mail.

Once you have your ID and password, you can logon to the ph service and
set your mail  service to <B>store</B> by following these steps:

<UL>
<LI> Open the website,
<A href="http://directory.purdue.edu/">http://directory.purdue.edu/</a>
<LI>Click on <B>Change your entry</B> at the bottom of the page
<LI>You will be prompted to logon to the ph system.
<LI>Logon with your ph alias and password.
<LI>Click on <B>Change service</B>.
<LI>Change the default <B>reject</B> to <B>store</B> and click on
"OK."
</UL>

<P>
At this point you will be able to receive mail at an address which
looks like

<P>
<TT>
firstname.initial.lastname.number@purdue.edu
</TT>

<P>
However, you have the option of setting up a shorter alias.
More information can be found at
<A href="http://directory.purdue.edu/">
http://directory.purdue.edu/</a>.

<p>
The next step is to create a file called <tt>.forward</tt> in your directory
at math with the following two lines:

<P>
<TT>
\your-math-login@math.purdue.edu <br>
your-mailhub-name@purdue.edu <br><br>
</TT>

<P>
(Of course, "your-..." should be replaced by your actual login id's).

<P>
The effect of this is to forward a copy of all email
sent to the math department to your new account, while keeping a copy
on the math department system.  (The "\" in the first line is designed to
prevent a disastrous infinite loop, so either OMIT THE FIRST LINE
if you don't plan on checking email from math, or KEEP THE BACKSLASH.)

<p>
Finally you'll have to set up things on your home computer.
I'll assume that you've successfully set up  PPP.  Then,
if you haven't already done so, you'll need to install an email program,
such as <I>Eudora</I> (see
<A href="http://www.eudora.com">http://www.eudora.com</a>),
that can handle the <B>POP</B> mail protocol.
You'll need to configure this appropriately. Although
the specific steps depend on your software, one way or another
you will need to give it the following information:

<P>
<UL>
<LI>
the  pop server (<TT>postoffice.purdue.edu</TT>),
<LI>
your mail-hub login id or alias,
<LI>
your mail-hub password,
<LI>
the smtp server (e.g. <TT>gauss.math.purdue.edu</TT>
if you're dialing up through math) <br>
</UL>

<p>
That's it. To check your email from home
just dial up and connect to the server and  get your mail, then
disconnect. You can now read it at your leisure.  Similarly you
can compose your email without being connected, and then dial up
only when it's time to send it.  If you're at the math department,
you'll have a duplicate copy of all email on the local
mail spool, so you can use elm, pine, xmail or whatever you normally
use to check it.

<p>
There are a couple of variations on the above instructions.  For
example, if you use a commercial internet provider, you should
be able to modify the above instructions to forward mail to that
address.  Also you can use more than one computer to  check mail
at your ...@purdue.edu address.  For example, in addition
to a home computer, you can set up Netscape running on a workstation
here to do this also.  If you do this but want to keep a copy
of all received email on one particular machine, you can set up the other
emailers  to leave the email on the server (or if you can't then
try another emailer).
