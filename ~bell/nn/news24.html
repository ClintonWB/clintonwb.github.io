How to make your home PC feel just like your office computer
</H1>

<P>
If you've been running Windows 95 and using a 2400 baud modem
to connect to the Math Dept SUN's since 1997, this volume of
the Network News is for you.  I explain here how you can upgrade
your system beyond your wildest imaginings so that it begins to
function much like a SUN workstation on the <tt>math.purdue.edu</tt>
network.  At the same time, this upgrade will greatly improve
the security of your connection.

<P>
Mac users: see <A HREF="./news25.html">Volume 25</A>, by
Rodrigo Ba&ntilde;uelos.

<P>
First, you can easily and cheaply upgrade your operating system to
Windows XP.  Like me, you might be surprised how
much better various things work after the upgrade.  Purdue faculty
and students can buy the Windows XP upgrade packages from
the Copy Center in the Purdue Union for a mere $5.  For an additional
$5, faculty can also buy the Microsoft 2003 Office package that
contains MS-Word and Excel.  Go to
<A HREF="http://www.purdue.edu/msca">http://www.purdue.edu/msca</A>
to see a list of what other software is available.

<P>
If you used to telnet to <tt>banach.math.purdue.edu</tt> from home
to check your math e-mail and work on files, you will certainly want
to set up software on your home machine to run a "secure shell."  You
can download a nice version of <tt>ssh Secure CRT</tt> software, 
free for Purdue people, at
<A HREF="https://engineering.purdue.edu/PULS/">
https://engineering.purdue.edu/PULS/</A>.  You'll need to give your
Purdue Career accound login id and password to do the download.   (It
is the same as the software you can buy from
<A HREF="http://www.ssh.com">http://www.ssh.com</A>.)
It is very simple to install and
run and it works very nicely.  The ssh connection makes your password
and everything else you send over the phone lines encrypted.  (A plain
oldfashioned telnet connection does not and it is possible for someone
to "sniff" the line and get your login and password.)

<P>
Next, get a DSL connection from Verizon or a cable modem connection
from Insight Digital.  You will be able to browse the web and download
files at home with nearly the same ease that you do in your office, and
you won't tie up your home phone line.

<P>
If you have a fast connection and you want to use X-window applications
from your home computer that are running on a math machine, you will
need to set up X-server software.  Purdue faculty and graduate students
may download and install <tt>PC X-ware</tt>  on personally
owned PC-compatible computers from
<A HREF="https://engineering.purdue.edu/PULS/">
Purdue PC X-ware download site</A> for free.  (Don't bother with
X-servers if you use a slow dial-up connection.  They will be so
slow and drippy as to drive you insane.)  However, if you are like me
and only use a few X-programs like <tt>xdvi</tt> from home, you won't
need the full blown thing from PC X-ware.  Robert McGraw told me about a
free, small, and very functional X-server called <tt>Xming</tt>.  It
is based on the well designed Cygwin system.  See this
<A HREF="http://gears.aset.psu.edu/hpc/guides/xming/">site at Penn
State</A> for links to download Xming and a nice explanation of how to
use it to tunnel X-connections through your secure shell program.

<P>
To get a <I>secure</I> X connection that works exactly as the one described
for PUCC PC's at Louis Scott's
<A HREF="http://www.math.purdue.edu/~bell/nn/PUCC">Special Issue</A>,
of the Network News, you will need to log onto a math machine via the
secure SSH program described above and click on the <tt>Settings</tt>
icon (two little gears) and click on <tt>Tunneling</tt>
under <tt>Profile Settings</tt>.  Put a check mark in the box that says
"Tunnel X11 Connections" and click on OK.  (Select Save Settings from
the FILE menu so that you will never have to do this again.)

<P>
You'll need to start your X-server (by clicking on the little Xming icon,
for example) before or after you start SSH to get the X connection.
After that, you can type a command like <tt>xdvi paper.dvi</tt> in the
secure SSH window and an xdvi X-window should pop up on your home screen
just like it would in your office.

<P>
You should be warned that DSL or cable modem connections 
hook your home computer onto the internet with its own IP address.
Although it is against the law for an unwelcome hacker to gain access
to and alter your home computer files, it is quite possible.  I became
paranoid about this after I ran a program called Black Ice
Defender on my home computer and discovered that between 10 and 20
different people a day seemed to be snooping around by my machine.
Be sure to turn on the software firewall in Windows XP.

<P>
Finally, I should mention in closing that I accomplished all of the
things above with a fair amount of cursing and gnashing of teeth.
