MATH DEPT Computer News, Volume 18
</H1>

<P>
<H1>
A new computer just for you!
</H1>

<P>
I explain here how to give your computer a nice new look and
feel, the look and feel of a brand-spanking new machine.

<P>
<HR>

Click on <B>RELOAD</B> now.  This page is frequently updated and
you might be looking at an old version saved by your netscape cache.

<P>
<HR>

<P>
If you are like me, you have let your DOT files rot over the
years.  In particular, your <tt>.cshrc</tt> might be a relic
of the pre-solaris era.  To freshen up your machine, you will need
to install the newest, latest version of the math dept dot files
that come with new accounts.  I will explain two ways to do this,
a fast way and a slow way.  First the fast way:

<P>
<HR>

<P>
There is a new command on our system that will give you all new
dot files in one fell swoop.  Type

<P>
<PRE>
cd /pkgs/misc/bin
ls
</PRE>

<P>
You will see a command called <tt>make_standard</tt> that Dan
Shaw has designed to allow users to give themselves all the newest and
most improved standard dot files.  The command is just a standard
shell script and is plain text.  You can type

<P>
<PRE>
more make_standard
</PRE>

<P>
while you are in the directory <tt>/pkgs/misc/bin</tt> and hit
the space bar to scroll to see what the command will do for
you.  If you want to give it a try, type the command

<P>
<PRE>
make_standard -f
</PRE>

<P>
(or type <tt>/pkgs/misc/bin make_standard -f</tt> from your home
directory) and all your old dot files will be placed in a directory
called

<P>
<tt>
Dotfiles-&lt;today's date&gt;-&lt;process id&gt;
</tt>

<P>
in your home directory, and new dot files will be put in your home
directory.  After you log off and back on, you will notice that suddenly
your X-windows have a nice new feel and many other things might work better,
too.  (I explain below how to use the new X-window system, Ice Windows).

<P>
<HR>

<P>
Now the slow way:

<P>
If you are afraid to use the make_standard script, you can go
through the process manually as follows.

<H2>
STEP 1
</H2>

<P>
First move your current antique <tt>.cshrc</tt> file out of the
way (but don't trash it) by typing

<P>
<PRE>
cd
mv  .cshrc  .cshrc.old
</PRE>

<P>
Next, you will need to copy the new standard <tt>.cshrc</tt> file
to your home directory.  Do this by typing

<P>
<PRE>
cp  /pkgs/share/local/sample-files/.cshrc  ~
</PRE>

<P>
Notes: the tilde (<tt>~</tt>) in the command above is UNIX shorthand
for your home directory.  There are no spaces in the long
string,<br>
<tt>/pkgs/share/local/sample-files/.cshrc</tt><br>
Long strings like this are such a bear to type that I suggest that
you use the following standard method to copy and paste text.
Left mouse click and drag over the whole long <tt>cp</tt> command
above.  Now left click in the window where you want to run the command
and then click on the middle mouse button.  The text you dragged over
will be spit out at the command line.  Now push RETURN.

<P>
Now repeat the process for your <tt>.login</tt> file, i.e., type

<P>
<PRE>
cd
mv  .login  .login.old
cp  /pkgs/share/local/sample-files/.login  ~
</PRE>

<P>
Next, you should examine your old .cshrc and .login files for
aliases and special settings commands that you like and copy
the relevant lines to the new versions.  For example, I copied

<P>
<PRE>
alias lo logout
</PRE>

<P>
from my old <tt>.cshrc</tt> to the END of my new one, and I copied

<P>
<PRE>
# Choose a printer:
setenv PRINTER lpub7
</PRE>

<P>
to the point in my new <tt>.login</tt> file where it suggests that
you set your personal environmental variables.

<P>
NOTE:  If you try to edit one of your new files and the
system tells you that the file is <I>read only</I>, you
will need to "change the mode" of the file to give yourself
write permission.  For example, to give yourself write
permission on your new <tt>.cshrc</tt> file, just type

<P>
<PRE>
cd
chmod  u+w  .cshrc
</PRE>

<P>
For the whole story about UNIX file permissions, see

<P>
<A HREF="./filemodes">Unix file permissions</A>

<H2>
STEP 2
</H2>

<P>
There is a new window manager available and it is very nice.  I
just love it.  It is called Ice Window Manager (icewm).  I will
explain its main features and how to set it up.

<P>
To start using icewm, you will first need to copy the new standard
<tt>.Xdefaults</tt> file that comes with new accounts to your home
directory.  (The <tt>make_standard</tt> command described above
does this for you.  The instructions that follow explain how to
do this manually.)

<P>
First, move your old .Xdefaults file out of the way:

<P>
<PRE>
cd
mv  .Xdefaults  .Xdefaults.old 
</PRE>

<P>
Next, type

<P>
<PRE>
cp  /pkgs/share/local/sample-files/.Xdefaults  ~
</PRE>

<P>
You probably don't have a <tt>.Xrc.math</tt> file at the moment.  However,
if you do, you'll need to move it too by typing

<P>
<PRE>
cd
mv  .Xrc.math  .Xrc.math.old 
</PRE>

<P>
Now you are safe to copy the new <tt>.Xrc.math</tt> startup file by typing

<P>
<PRE>
cp  /pkgs/share/local/sample-files/.Xrc.math  ~
</PRE>

<P>
Finally, you should move any old dot files you might have
with the following names out of the way:

<P>
<PRE>
.xinitrc
.Xinitrc
.xrc
.Xrc
</PRE>

<P>
e.g., by typing

<P>
<PRE>
cd
mv  .xinitrc  .xinitrc.old
</PRE>

<P>
NOTE:
If you end up with so many <tt>.old</tt> files that they are
cluttering up your home directory, you might consider making
a separate directory to stash them in.  For example, type

<P>
<PRE>
cd
mkdir Oldstuff
mv .cshrc.old  Oldstuff/cshrc.old
</PRE>

<P>
to create an <tt>Oldstuff</tt> subdirectory in your Home directory
and to move <tt>.cshrc.old</tt> from your home directory to a file
called <tt>cshrc.old</tt> in your new subdirectory.

<H2>
STEP 3
</H2>

<P>
Next, get a bottle of WINDEX and clean your keyboard and monitor.
Then log off and log back on.  Voila!  You've got a new computer!

<P>

<H2>
How to personalize your colors, windows, fonts, etc. in icewm.
</H2>

<P>
I'll tell you here what I did to make icewm look and act
the way I wanted it to.  I'll also explain some of the nifty
features about icewm that you will probably like.  I learned this
stuff from the online documentation that is available at

<P>
<A HREF="file:/pkgs/X11/src/PURDUE_MATH/icewm/icewm-1.0.1/doc/icewm.html">
/pkgs/X11/src/PURDUE_MATH/icewm/icewm-1.0.1/doc/icewm.html</A>

<P>
that you can access from a math machine by clicking on the link
above or by typing

<P>
<PRE>
netscape /pkgs/X11/src/PURDUE_MATH/icewm/icewm-1.0.1/doc/icewm.html &
</PRE>

<P>
I wasn't very wild about the black/white feel of my xterm
windows and some hard to read fonts, so I changed the following
lines in my new .Xdefaults from

<P>
<PRE>
! Defaults for Xterm

XTerm*VT100*geometry: 80x24
XTerm*VT100*font: -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--15-140-*
XTerm*scrollBar: on
XTerm*saveLines: 200
XTerm*loginShell: on
XTerm*reverseWrap: on
XTerm*foreground: White
XTerm*background: Black
XTerm*reverseVideo: true
XTerm*cursorColor: Green
XTerm*pointerColorBackground: Black
XTerm*pointerColor: Red
</PRE>

<P>
to the following:

<P>
<PRE>
! Defaults for Xterm

XTerm*VT100*geometry: 80x35
XTerm*VT100*font: lucidasanstypewriter-18
XTerm*VT100*font2: lucidasanstypewriter-10
XTerm*VT100*font3: lucidasanstypewriter-12
XTerm*VT100*font4: lucidasanstypewriter-14
XTerm*VT100*font5: lucidasanstypewriter-18
XTerm*VT100*font6: lucidasanstypewriter-bold-24
XTerm*font: lucidasanstypewriter-14
XTerm*scrollBar: on
XTerm*saveLines: 500
XTerm*loginShell: on
XTerm*reverseWrap: on
XTerm*foreground: black
XTerm*background: gray65
XTerm*cursorColor: ivory
XTerm*pointerColor: black
XTerm*pointerColorBackground: red
</PRE>

<P>
WARNING: The <tt>.Xdefaults</tt> file is very sensitive to things
like extra spaces at the ends of lines.  Make sure there aren't any.

<P>
You can experiment with different colors to see what you
like best.  (NOTE: You'll need to log off and back on again to
see the effect of your changes.)  A nice way to see the names
of all the available colors is to type

<P>
<PRE>
xco &
</PRE>

<P>
in an xterm window.

<P>
I also didn't like some of the settings that were chosen
by default in the system file.  The system reads the default
preferences in

<P>
<PRE>
/pkgs/X11/lib/X11/icewm/preferences
</PRE>

<P>
To change them, I first created a <tt>.icewm</tt> directory
in my home directory by typing

<P>
<PRE>
cd
mkdir  .icewm
</PRE>

<P>
Then I copied the system preferences file to this new directory
by typing

<P>
<PRE>
cp  /pkgs/X11/lib/X11/icewm/preferences  ~/.icewm
</PRE>

<P>
Then I edited certain lines of my personal copy of the
preferences file in ~/.icewm  to read as follows.
(NOTE: You'll need to log off and back on again to
see the effect of your changes.)

<P>
<PRE>
#  Pass focusing click on client area to client
PassFirstClickToClient=0 # 0/1
</PRE>

<P>
This is important if you like to left-mouse-button drag
over text to select it and then middle click to spit it
out.  (If you don't change this, you will find that if
you have selected text and then click in another window
to make it active, you will unselect the text you had and
select a little glob of text where you slipped when you
clicked the new window.)

<P>
<PRE>
#  Beep when new mail arrives
TaskBarMailboxStatusBeepOnNewMail=1 # 0/1
</PRE>

<P>
Of course!  Get real.  How else can I keep up my perfect
record of answering or deleting e-mail within fifteen seconds
of receipt?

<P>
<PRE>
#  Show workspace switching buttons on task bar
TaskBarShowWorkspaces=1 # 0/1
</PRE>

<P>
One feature of icewm that I really like is that there are
four separate windows in a row for you to use to do different
things.  It's like having four different computers in a row.
I do text editing in window one, e-mail in window two, netscape
in window three, and connect to other computers in window four.
You have this feature, but you might not have realized it.  By
changing the line above, I also get little buttons that say 1,2,3,4
on them so I can click on them to switch to a different space.
(I'll explain how to use the window spaces below.)

<P>
<PRE>
#  Confirm logout
ConfirmLogout=0 # 0/1
</PRE>

<P>
Don't bug me!  Just do it.

<P>
<PRE>
# Theme
Theme="nice/default.theme"
</PRE>

<P>
I didn't like the blacks and greys of the default window colors in
the default (<tt>warp3</tt>) theme.  This change makes the bars at
the top of the active windows blue instead of black.

<P>
That's all there is to it.

<P>
<HR>

<H2>
Nice features of the Ice Window Manager
</H2>

<P>
Left mouse click on a patch of background in your window.  A menu
pops up.  (If you can't find any background window because your
screen is covered with windows, just close some of them by clicking
on the X or minimize them by clicking on the _.)  The list of numbers,

<P>
<PRE>
2. 2
3. 3
4. 4
</PRE>

<P>
in the menu represent your other three separate window spaces.  Select
window space two by left or right mouse clicking on the 2.2 in the menu
and you will move to that space.  There's probably nothing there.  Your
different spaces will be empty at first.  To get an xterm going in window 2,
for example, click on the little terminal icon on the task bar at the bottom
of the screen.  Go back to space 1.1 by left mouse clicking on a patch
of background screen space and selecting 1.1 from the menu (or by clicking
on the little box numbered 1 on the task bar at the bottom of the screen
if you made the change to the preferences file that I suggested above).

<P>
Here is another good way to get something going in window space two.  Start
netscape by typing

<P>
<PRE>
netscape -install
</PRE>

<P>
in an xterm in window space 1.  (Note: the <tt>-install</tt> option of
Netscape makes the colors in Netscape local.  If you don't start Netscape
this way, you'll find that you run out of colors to run other programs
like the greyscale colors of xdvi, etc.  You can also start Netscape by
clicking on the little Netscape icon on the task bar at the bottom of
the screen, but it will hog colors that way.)

<P>
Now that Netscape is up and running in window space 1, right mouse
click on the bar at the top of the Netscape window.  A menu pops down.
Select

<P>
<b>Move to</b> 

<P>
from the list and then select 2.2 to move the Netscape window to
window space 2.

<P>
I find it very convenient to move through my window spaces by
pushing and holding the <tt>Alt</tt> key and then pushing the left
or right arrow keys.

<P>
icewm will make your machine feel quite a bit like a Microsoft windows
machine.  For example, you can minimize a window by clicking on the
little dash in the box at the upper right corner of the window and
an icon for it will appear on the task bar at the bottom of the
screen.  You can bring the window back up by clicking on its icon on
the task bar.  You can make the window fill the whole screen by
clicking on the maximize box in the upper right corner of the window.
Click on it again to return to the previous size.

<P>
Here's a nifty feature.  Click on the funny little up arrow in the
upper right hand corner of an xterm and you roll the window up like
a window shade.  Click on it again and it rolls back down.

<P>
Here are some other features you'll want to try out.  If you left
mouse click on some background, a menu list pops down.  If you
select "Windows list," a list of all your windows in all your
work spaces will pop up.  If you select a window on the list, you
will automatically suddenly get moved to the window space where
that window is and it will become the active window for input.
The "Windows list" is also opened if you middle mouse click in
the background.

<P>
If you right mouse click in the background, you'll get another
menu.  You can launch certain applications like an xterm or netscape
by selecting them from this list.  You can also other start programs
like xdvi by selecting them from the appropriate menu category.
Next on the right mouse menu is the "Windows list" again.  Under that
is a rather interesting item.  If you select "Themes," you can
change the look and feel of your windows without messing around
with the preferences startup file.  For example, choose "nice" and
then click on the little arrow and select "blue" and wait a few
seconds to see the edges around your windows and your menus turn blue.
If you like this blue stuff better than the default blacks and
greys of the default "warp3" theme, you will be disappointed the
next time you log in and find that your new selection has been
forgotten.  You can change the entry about themes in your preferences
file to

<P>
<PRE>
# Theme
Theme="nice/blue.theme"
</PRE>

<P>
to make the nice-blue one become your default that starts every time
you log on.  (If you want your window bars to be maroon instead of
blue, I explain how to change them <A HREF="./themes.html">here</A>.)

<P>
To LOGOUT of icewm, right mouse click on some background
and select the bottom entry, Logout, of the menu that pops down.
To get totally logged off, you might also need to type logout
at the UNIX prompt that might show up after you exit icewm.
