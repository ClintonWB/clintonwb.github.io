How to create an ASCII version of the Purdue Logo and other matters
of e-mail etiquette
</H1>

<P>
The Purdue logo...

<P>
<IMG SRC="http://www.math.purdue.edu/~bell/PU_signature_web.jpg">

<P>
... ah, yes, it is a thing of beauty!

<P>
The rules about how a Purdue employee must use the Purdue logo in
everyday activities are very well documented. See the 29 page
document, especially if you are thinking about stenciling the logo
on your car.

<P>
Although the logo is a thing of beauty, it is a rather large graphic in electronic
form, and I have found that it can hinder electronic communication.  That is why I
have taken it upon myself here to describe a means to obtain a much smaller electronic
version of the logo in ASCII format to use in e-mail.

<P>
Here is a lovely example of the logo in ASCII format that I have painstakingly
created (for official use by Purdue employees only, of course).   Feel free to
copy and paste it if you want to use it in an e-mail.

<P>
<PRE>
+---------------+
|  P U R D U E  |
|  -----------  |
|  UNIVERSITY   |
+---------------+
</PRE>

<P>
But I must warn you that there is a potential problem with this version of the logo.
It was designed to show nicely in a fixed width font.  If a recipient of the logo is not
using a fixed width font, it might look more like

<P>
<P>
+---------------+<BR>
|PURDUE |<BR>
|--------- |<BR>
|UNIVERSITY |<BR>
+---------------+<BR>

<P>
and that might summon the <I>Logo Police</I>.

<P>
It would be more reasonable to do away with the outer boundary and extra
spaces and to use something more like

<P>
<PRE>
PURDUE
----------
UNIVERSITY
</PRE>

<P>
Ouch!  But that looks so off balance.  And that line inbetween doesn't feel
right.

<P>
<PRE>
PURDUE
UNIVERSITY
</PRE>

<P>
There.  That's not bad.  But you know, many spam catching programs tag
a message with words in all capitals as spam.  (e.g., CHEAP PHARMACEUTICALS!).
They call it screaming text.

<P>
So I'd recommend using

<P>
<PRE>
Purdue
University
</PRE>

<P>
instead.

<P>
Finally, to avoid that jagged looking right edge, I like

<P>
<PRE>
Purdue University
</PRE>

<P>
<P>
... which is very economical in terms of computer memory and
printer paper, too.

<P>
While I am on the subject of how to write crisp and
readable e-mail, here are some maxims I have
learned over the years:

<UL>
<LI> If  your message can be conveyed by mere text, and yet
it is coded up in a large document with extraneous embedded
graphics (such as our beloved Purdue logo), it is usually
possible to use the EXPORT or SAVE AS option from the FILE menu
to convert and save the document to a text file.  Then send the text
file as a straight e-mail message, not as an attachment.  Send
it as plain ASCII text instead of using a font.
<LI>  Try not to attach multiple large files to any one message.
Send several large attachments in separate e-mails.
<LI> If the attachment is very large compared to its value as
a document, or if there is a strong chance that few if any
recipients have any desire to look at it, consider placing it
on the web someplace and merely e-mailing the URL for the document.
<LI> If you must send a formatted document, convert it to PDF
and attach it. The PDF file reader is free for all, whereas
programs like MSword are not.  If you do send a PDF attachment,
there is really no reason to add a duplicate MS Word second
attachment to the same message.
<LI> Don't use HTML to format your outgoing e-mail text messages.
It is easy to turn off the HTML feature for outgoing e-mail in
programs like Microsoft Outlook.  Just go to the OPTIONS submenu
of the TOOLS menu and click on the MAIL FORMAT tab.  Click on
the little down arrow next to the "Compose in this format"
selection box and choose PLAIN TEXT.  (Don't use Rich Text or
Word either, or any other program that creates large files for
comparatively meager text messages. Also, be aware that if you
use Word for an attachment, your recipients might be afraid to
open it because of the risk of receiving computer viruses via
Word files.)
