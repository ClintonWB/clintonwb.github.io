The math dept has a license for Mathematica, but only for use on the
single machine, <tt>bessel</tt>.  To use Mathematica from the math
dept SUN in front of you, first try to type

<P>
<tt>math</tt>

<P>
(which is short for "mathematica")
in an xterm window.  You should get a message that mathematica
is trying to start up on bessel and a new window should pop up
in a few seconds.  If you want a fancier x-window version of
mathematica, complete with equation making pallettes, etc., type

<P>
<tt>mathematica</tt>

<P>
If these commands don't successfully start up on bessel from
your machine, try typing

<P>
<tt>
xon bessel
</tt>

<P>
in an xterm window on your machine, and then type

<P>
<tt>
math
</tt>

<p>
or

<P>
<tt>
mathematica
</tt>

<P>
in the bessel xterm window that pops up.  If you type in a command like

<P>
<tt>
Plot[ Sin[x],{x,0,7}]
</tt>

<P>
and hit RETURN, a graphics window should pop up on your screen at
the console of the machine in front of you.
