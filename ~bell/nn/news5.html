How to use the e-Print Archive at <tt>http://xxx.lanl.gov/</tt>
</H1>

<P>
<HR>

Click on <B>RELOAD</B> now.  This page is frequently updated and
you might be looking at an old version saved by your netscape cache.

<P>
<HR>

<P>
I shall explain here how to post a paper to the e-Print Archive
at <A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/">http://xxx.lanl.gov/</A>.  First,
however, I shall explain the easy part:

<P>
<B>How to view papers at the site</B>.

<P>
Just point your
netscape browser to

<P>
<tt>
<A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/archive/math/">
http://xxx.lanl.gov/archive/math/</A>
</tt>

<P>
and select the links to your favorite subject.  If you click on
the <b>PDF</b> or <b>ps</b> link of a paper, the paper will
come up in a viewer and you can look at it and print it by
selecting PRINT on the viewer.  If you click on the <b>src</b>
link, you will be prompted to save the file to your own account.
The file will be a text file (TeX or LaTeX probably) that is
"gzipped" and "tarred."   For example, if the file is called
9804123, you will have to type

<P>
<tt>
gunzip 9804123
</tt>

<p>
to unzip it.  This might create a file like <tt>filename.tar</tt>

<P>
Then you might then need to run

<P>
<tt>
$ tar -xvf filename.tar
</tt>

<P>
to produce a 9804123.tex file (and maybe a few figure files, e.g.,
figure1.eps, to go with the tex file).  You will have to TeX the
file yourself to view or print the paper.

<P>
<B>Uploading your paper to the archive</B>.

<P>
One way to do this is to read all the on-line instructions at
<tt>
<A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/help/">http://xxx.lanl.gov/help/</A>
</tt> about uploading before you
try.  This takes a couple of hours and it is not as difficult
as the daunting instructions might lead you to believe.  I explain
here the bare bones for people submitting papers in AMS-TeX or
LaTeX without figures from a Math Dept SUN.  (See
<A HREF="#figures">below</A> for special instructions about papers
with PostScript figures.)

<P>
<H2>
Step 1
</H2>

<P>
The first step is to send an e-mail to the site to register
and to get an access id and password.  To do this, simply
send an empty e-mail to

<P>
<tt>hep-th@xxx.lanl.gov</tt>

<P>
with subject line

<P>
<tt>register</tt>

<P>
You will get an e-mail from them very quickly that contains
your user name (probably your last name) and your password.

<P>
After you get your id and password, go to

<P>
<tt>
<A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/help/registerhelp">
http://xxx.lanl.gov/help/registerhelp</A>
</tt>

<P>
and click on <B>REGISTRATION FORM</B> and fill out
the form.  (You will need to give your user-id and password to access
the form.)

<P>
<H2>
Step 2
</H2>

<P>
You will next want to go to the upload page.  You can upload
a single TeX file quite easily.  However, if you have separate
figure files, you will need to package your TeX paper in the format
required by the e-Print service.  They want their papers in
TeX with figures to be tarred and gzipped.  Let's say your paper
is called <tt>paper.tex</tt> and that you keep it in your directory
<tt>/homes/your_id/Papers/</tt>.  Let's also say that you have two
figure files called <tt>fig1.eps</tt> and <tt>fig2.eps</tt>.  To tar and
gzip your files, first cd to <tt>/homes/your_id/Papers/</tt> and then type

<P>
<tt>
$ tar -cvf mypaper.tar paper.tex fig1.eps fig2.eps
</tt>

<P>
This command will create the file <tt>mypaper.tar</tt>

<P>
Warning: If you forget to type the filename <tt>mypaper.tar</tt>, tar will over-write
the first file name it sees (in this case paper.tex is next in line).

<P>
Next, you will want to use gzip to compress the tar file for fastest upload: 

<P>
<tt>
$ gzip mypaper.tar
</tt>

<P>
which will create a file named <tt>mypaper.tar.gz</tt>

<P>
<B>NOTE:</B> Certain AMS-TeX commands that we use around here
need to be removed from your TeX file before you send it.  For
example, you will need to comment out (by putting a % in front
of the line) the commands \NoBlackBoxes and \nologo.

<P>
<H2>
Step 3
</H2>

<P>
Next, you should type a short abstract of your paper and put it
in a file all by itself.  (I just copy mine from the paper.)  If
you know how to left mouse button drag and middle button click to
copy and move text, you can drag over this abstract text from
the file and then copy it to the proper box in the upload form
at upload time.

<P>
<H2>
Step 4
</H2>

<P>
Finally, you are ready to upload.  Go to

<P>
<tt>
<A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/help/uploads">http://xxx.lanl.gov/help/uploads</A>
</tt>

<P>
and select the UPLOADS link.  You will be asked for your
access-id and your password before the upload form appears.
Fill in the form at the uploads page and copy your abstract
to the abstract box.

<P>
When everything looks perfect, go down to the UPLOAD FILE box
and select BROWSE.  You will see a listing of your own files.
If it is not already selected, scroll to your Papers directory
(/u3/your_id/Papers/ in this example) and click on it.  A listing of
the files in the Papers directory should appear.  Click on
/u3/your_id/Papers/paper.tar.gz and select OK.  This file name should
now appear in the UPLOAD FILE box.  Select UPLOAD NOW and you will be
done.  The archive will TeX your paper and create PostScript versions
for the web.  (Follow the instructions that come up to verify that
your paper has been received and TeXed properly.)

<H2>
<A NAME="figures">Papers with figures</A>
</H2>

<P>
If your paper has PostScript figures in it, you will want to
bundle them with your TeX file.  Suppose you have encapsulated
postscript files  <tt>figure1.eps</tt> and <tt>figure2.eps</tt>
that you want to include with your TeX source file.  Simply
type

<P>
<tt>
tar cf - paper.tex figure1.eps figure2.eps | gzip > paper.tar.gz
</tt>

<P>
to create one gzipped tarred file that contains all the pieces
of your paper.  Now follow the instructions above for uploading
your paper.
