How to submit an NSF proposal via the fastlane at
</H1>

<P>
<A HREF="http://www.fastlane.nsf.gov"><tt>http://www.fastlane.nsf.gov</tt></A>

<P>
<I>It's fast, it's easy, it's fun, it won't improve your chances.</I>

<P>
<HR>

Click on <B>RELOAD</B> now.  This page is frequently updated and
you might be looking at an old version saved by your netscape cache.

<P>
<HR>

<P>
I just finished uploading my NSF proposal via the fastlane and I think
it is the way to go.  I'll explain here what I did.  Don't be afraid
to mess around in the fastlane.  You can delete and overwrite pieces
of your proposal a million times and nobody will ever know about it.
The fastlane is for creating a proposal bit by bit from scratch and
what you are doing will not be released or visible to anybody but you
until the whole thing is done and you click on the <tt>ALLOW SRO ACCESS</tt>
box (explained below).  The more you play around there, the more
comfortable you will be that the thing really works.  I believe it does.
I trust it more than I trust Purdue DSP to make 10 copies of my
proposal and mail them in a timely manner to the correct address.

<P>
If after reading this you decide that you want to upload your
proposal, but you are nervous about doing it yourself, Betty or I
can do it for you in 5 minutes.  We've done it for several people now.

<P>
<H2>Step 1</H2>

<P>
First, call Kim Dixon (4-4958) at Purdue DSP and tell her that you will
be preparing an NSF proposal this season.  She will give you a PIN number
that will allow you to submit and edit pieces of your NSF proposal at the
fastlane.

<P>
<H2>Step 2</H2>

<P>
Prepare your proposal in TeX as usual, but cut it into four pieces
like this:

<PRE>
sum.tex       A. PROJECT SUMMARY
nsf.tex       C. PROJECT DESCRIPTION (including results from prior...)
refs.tex      D. REFERENCES
bio.tex       E. BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH
</PRE>

<P>
(Section B. is the TABLE OF CONTENTS which gets generated
automatically at the fastlane.)

<P>
If you are using <tt>latex</tt> with automatic reference
tags, see <A HREF="./latex.html">this little note.</A>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
About page numbering, computer wiz, Joe Lipman, found
the answer below in the online documentation at the fastlane:

<P>
From NSF fastlane FAQ's:

<P>
<I>How should I paginate my FastLane proposal?</I>

<P>
You should number the first page of the Project Description as
number 1. Each other section of the proposal that you can number
(the forms that you upload as PDF files) you should number
beginning with number 1.

<P>
<HR>

<P>
However, the published instructions for NSF proposals say the
pages must be numbered consecutively through the end of the proposal
and so that FAQ should be a never asked question.
I wouldn't worry too much about your page numbering system.  I
have an e-mail from one of the program directors that says that
it doesn't really matter how you do it.

<P>
If you want to set your page numbers to something different than
is natural, use an AMS-TeX command like

<P>
<tt>
\pageno=7
</tt>

<P>
or a LaTeX command like

<P>
<tt>
\setcounter{page}{7}
</tt>

<P>
<H2>Step 3</H2>

<P>
Next, create the following PDF files to be uploaded to the NSF main
computer.

<PRE>
sum.pdf
nsf.pdf
refs.pdf
bio.pdf
</PRE>

<P>
For example, to create <tt>nsf.pdf</tt> just run the following
sequence of commands:

<P>
<tt>
amstex nsf.tex<br>
dvips -Pweb nsf.dvi<br>
distill nsf.ps<br>
</tt>

<P>
The last command creates a file called <tt>nsf.pdf</tt> that
you can view by typing

<P>
<tt>
acroread nsf.pdf &
</tt>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
NOTE:

This page is rather outdated.  The new Linux servers support
the commands <tt>pdflatex</tt> and <tt>pdftex</tt> that create
a PDF file directly from the TeX source file.  If you run TeX 
to create a DVI file, you can then run <tt>dvipdf</tt>, which 
will create a PDF file from the DVI file.  There is also
<tt>ps2pdf</tt> that will convert a PostScript file to PDF.

<P>
<HR>

<P>
<H2>Step 4</H2>

<P>
The Purdue DSP office initializes your proposal cover page for you.
They botched mine up a bit and I had to go in and fix it myself.  This
turned out to be easy.  First, cd to the directory in which you store
your NSF proposal PDF files and type

<P>
<tt>
netscape http://www.fastlane.nsf.gov &
</tt>

<P>
and scroll down and click on

<P>
<tt>
Proposal Preparation
</tt>

<P>
You will get a window with three boxes.  Click in the first box and
type your last name (lower case is ok).  Next, click in the second
box and type in your social security number (without spaces or
hyphens).  Next, click in the third box and type the four digit
PIN that Kim Dixon gives you.  (Note, don't use the TAB key to move
from one input box to another.  It chokes on it.)  Finally, click on
the <B>Proposal Preparation</B> box.  You will get a screen with your
personal data on it.

<HR>

<H2>IMPORTANT</H2>

Do not use the <B>Back</B> and <B>Forward</B> buttons of Netscape to
move around the fastlane.  You must use the <B>OK</B> and
<B>CANCEL</B> buttons provided on the web pages at the NSF instead or
the whole thing will get fouled up.

<HR>

<P>
You will probably notice that your personal data is botched up.  Click
on the

<P>
<tt>
EDIT INFORMATION
</tt>

<P>
box near the bottom of the information rectangle and edit the fields
that are empty or wrong.  Input phone numbers without hyphens, spaces,
or parentheses.  (If the thing demands that you fill in your address
line that you left blank, fill in

<P>
<tt>
1395 Mathematical Sciences
</tt>

<P>
and click on OK.)  One element of mine that was particularly wrong was the
check button that said I had never been a PI or CO/PI of an NSF
grant before.  It's near the bottom.  Make sure it's right.

<P>
Your personal data should look ok now.  This first web page of your
NSF proposal area is the front door to your proposal.  It is the one
place you can (and must) use the Netscape buttons to exit from.  From
anyplace else, click on CANCEL or OK until you are back to this front
door to get out.

<P>
<H2>Step 5</H2>

<P>
Now that the front end of your proposal looks ok, go to the

<P>
<tt>
PROPOSAL ACTIONS
</tt>

<P>
box near the bottom and make sure the <tt>STANDARD PROPOSAL</tt> box is
checked and click on OK.

<P>
A temporary NSF proposal number should be highlighted in the
rectangle.  Click on the EDIT box under the rectangle.  The EDIT
box takes you to a sceen that allows you to view or edit the
various pieces of your proposal.

<P>
Click on the <tt>PROJECT SUMMARY</tt> button in the rectangle and then
click on the

<P>
<tt>
GO TO FORM
</tt>

<P>
box at the bottom of the rectangle.  If you had submitted a Project
Summary earlier, you could view it by clicking on <tt>DISPLAY CURRENT
SUMMARY</tt>.  The first time you find yourself here, you will probably
want to upload a PDF file containing your Project Summary.  Click on
the BROWSE box near the bottom of the page.  A list of your files
on the computer in front of you will appear.  If you started Netscape
from the directory in which you store your NSF proposal files, you'll
see something like this in the FILE box:

<P>
<tt>
/u/u9/bell/Proposals/
</tt>

<P>
Type the filename of your project summary PDF file at the end of this
line so it looks something like

<P>
<tt>
/u/u9/bell/Proposals/sum98.pdf
</tt>

<P>
or better yet, scroll the files by until you see the one you
want and then double click on it (or select OK).

<P>
(You can use the arrow keys to scroll this long string if it doesn't
fit in the little box so you can verify that it is all there.)

<P>
Click on OK and then click on the TRANSFER PDF box.  Click on OK
until you have confirmation that the NSF computer has received your file.

<P>
When you have finished uploading your project summary, you can click
on the DISPLAY CURRENT SUMMARY box near the top to verify that the
NSF has what you think it has.  When you click on this box, the PDF
file will pop up in an ACROREAD reader (be patient, it could take a
long time for the window to pop up after you click on the display
button).  If you want to change your summary, click on the DELETE box
and then start Step 5 over again.

<P>
When you are satisfied that everything is ok with your summary, click on

<P>
<tt>
RETURN TO FORM SELECTOR
</tt>

<P>
Repeat this process for each of the other three items:

<PRE>
nsf.pdf
refs.pdf
bio.pdf
</PRE>

<P>
<H2>Step 6</H2>

<P>
Ask the business office to upload your COVER PAGE and BUDGET and
CURRENT AND PENDING SUPPORT items.  After this is done, you will
notice that the proposal title will appear next to the temporary
number in the rectangle.  (Make sure you only have one proposal
in preparation.  I once started a second one by mistake and had
to delete it by highlighting it in the box and then clicking on
DELETE.)

<P>
<H2>Step 7</H2>

<P>
When you think your proposal is totally done, go to the PROPOSAL
PREPARATION KIT box and click on PRINT underneath the box.  Select
PRINT THE WHOLE PROPOSAL in the box that pops up.  Your
proposal will appear all shiny and finished looking in an acroread
reader window (after a 20 or more seconds wait).  Select PRINT from
the FILE menu of the acroread window and your proposal will print
on your default printer.  Take it to the business office to be copied
to Purdue DSP with signatures, etc.

<P>
<H2>Step 8</H2>

<P>
One last thing to do:  when the business office says you are done
and you say you are done, click on the

<P>
<tt>
ALLOW SRO ACCESS
</tt>

<P>
button underneath the proposal preparation kit rectangle.  This
clears the thing to be released by Purdue DSP so that the NSF
can send it out for review.

<P>
I don't know what happens next, but I'm sure it will be disappointing.
