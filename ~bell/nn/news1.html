The math department network has changed recently with
the addition of solaris machines and a new policy of installing
programs like MAPLE as "packages" in directories of their own.  I
shall try to explain what the general user needs to know in order
to take advantage of these changes and to avoid certain problems.

<P>
If you want your .cshrc problems solved with an absolute minimum of effort,
here is a <A HREF="./cshrc.txt">sample .csrhc file</A> that is easy to
install and modify, or you can try this link:

What is Solaris?
</H2>

<P>
Most UNIX users will not notice the difference between a solaris
machine and a non-solaris machine.  It is only at the level of setting
up accounts that solaris and sunos differ.  The changes in our system
require you to know a couple things about this.

<P>
To test whether or not you are currently logged on to a solaris
machine (i.e., a machine that uses the solaris operating system),
type

<P>
<tt>uname -r</tt>

<P>
If the output of this command looks like 4.1.3_U1 (or 4.something),
then you are not on a solaris machine.  You are on a machine that
uses the old sunos operating system.  We will call this type of
machine a <B>sunos</B> machine.

<P>
If the output of the uname -r  command looks like 5.5.1 (or 5.something),
then you are on a <B>solaris</B> machine.

<P>
A sticky problem that has recently come up is that the
UNIX path variable needs to be set differently on the two different
operating systems.

<H2>
What is your <I>path?</I>
</H2>

<P>
To see your current path, type

<P>
<tt>echo $path</tt>

<P>
You will see a list of UNIX directory names separated by spaces.
This is where UNIX looks for the commands that you type.  (For
example, the rm command is in /usr/local/bin on a sunos machine
and in /usr/bin on a solaris machine.  If these directories are
not in your path, UNIX won't know what the rm command is.)

<P>
The bare bones of your path are set by the system in a file called

<P>
<tt>
/usr/share/standard/sys.cshrc
</tt>

<P>
that is called by your personal .cshrc whenever you open a new
window (or shell).  You will want to add some lines to your personal
.cshrc file (which resides in your home directory) to add some commands
to your path.  For example, to add the new TeX to your path
on sunos machines, you will want to add the line

<P>
<tt>
set path=( /usr/local/teTeX/bin/sparc-sunos4.1.3_U1 $path )
</tt>

<P>
to your .cshrc file at a point below the line that looks like

<P>
<tt>
source /usr/share/standard/sys.cshrc
</tt>

<P>
NOTE: To determine the version of TeX that you are using right now,
you can type

<P>
<tt>
which amstex
</tt>

<P>
If the output of this command is

<P>
<tt>
/usr/local/TeX/bin/amstex
</tt>

<P>
then you are using the old TeX and you won't be happy with it
for very much longer.

<P>
To add the new MAPLE V release 4 to your path on sunos machines,
you will add the line

<P>
<tt>
set path=( /usr/local/maple/bin $path )
</tt>

<P>
To add the new Acrobat3 package to your path on sunos machines (so
that you can view and create TeX files on the web in the form of .pdf
files), you will add the line

<P>
<tt>
set path=( /usr/local/Acrobat3/bin $path )
</tt>

<P>
You can add several packages at once like this:

<P>
<tt>
set path=( /usr/local/{maple,Acrobat3,netpbm,mh}/bin $path )
</tt>

<P>
The same things can be done on solaris machines via lines like this:

<P>
<tt>
set path=( /usr/local/teTeX/bin/sparc-solaris2.5.1 $path )<br>
set path=( /opt/{maple,Acrobat3,netpbm,mh}/bin $path )<br>
</tt>


<P>
To see other "packages" that you might want to add to your path,
on sunos type

<P>
<tt>
ls -d /usr/local/*/bin
</tt>

<P>
and on solaris, type

<P>
<tt>
ls -d /opt/*/bin
</tt>

<P>
(and see also Brad Lucier's e-mail at the bottom of this page).


<P>
If you log on to both sunos and solaris machines at various times,
you will want to add a "switch" command to your .cshrc file so
that your path is modified correctly depending on what kind of
machine you are on.  The following sequence of lines works nicely:

<P>
<PRE>
<tt>
switch (`uname -r`)      # those are backquotes around uname -r
      case 5*:
        set system=solaris
        breaksw
      default:
        set system=sunos
        breaksw
endsw

switch ($system)

   case sunos:
   set path = ( /usr/local/teTeX/bin/sparc-sunos4.1.3_U1 \
        /usr/local/{maple,Acrobat3,netpbm,mh}/bin \
        $path \
        ~/bin \
        . )
   breaksw

   case solaris:
   set path = ( /usr/local/teTeX/bin/sparc-solaris2.5.1 \
        /opt/{maple,Acrobat3,netpbm,mh}/bin \
        $path \
        ~/bin \
        . )
   breaksw

endsw
</tt>
</PRE>

If you don't want to risk botching up your .cshrc file,
click <A HREF="../cshrc.html">HERE</A>, fill out the form,
follow the simple instructions, then click on SUBMIT at the bottom
of the form.  A sample .cshrc file will be displayed that you can
download and install (or you can just study it as an example).
We have not covered the problem of expanding your MANPATH variable
here, but this problem is handled in the .cshrc file generated
at the link above.  If you want to know more about your MANPATH,
