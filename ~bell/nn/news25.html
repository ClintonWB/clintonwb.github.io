NOTE:  These instructions are now rather obsolete.  The whole business
of TeX on Mac OS is even easier now for the X11 server and "fink" ("fink" 
compiles and installs unix-linux applications).  Both, the X11 server 
and the fink package manager are very easy to install and setup.
Stay tuned for an update from Rodrigo later this year.

<P>
Here are some instructions on how to get TeX working on an "out of the
box" new Mac and pay no money for it.  I hope they help, but proceed at
your own risk.  I am not responsible if after you try this your
beautiful new Mac behaves badly, does not boot, or worst, it explodes
after reboot.

<P>
As you probably know, OS-X is a UNIX-based operating system and, as such all
UNIX programs should, in practice, run on the system.  Indeed, people
have ported hundreds of UNIX-LINUX programs to OS-X, including teTeX.
(teTeX is the same texing system used by the math department network
machines.)  However, unlike some other UNIX-type systems around (such
as linux), OS-X does not use the "xwindows" system.  Its front-end user
interface is called "Aqua". For this reason, you need to install teTeX
and a TeX previewer different from "xdvi".  OS-X does have a "command-
line terminal," which leads some to think that it is an x-terminal,
but it is not.  Fortunately, you do not need the "xwindow" system to
run teTeX, but you do need something to see your math after you tex it.

<H2>
Installing teTeX
</H2>

<P>
Go to
<A HREF="http://www.rna.nl/tex.html">http://www.rna.nl/tex.html</A>
and scroll down
to "TeX Installation and Configuration Products".  Click on "TeX.dmg"
to begin downloading it.  (Warning: You probably should not do this via
modem.  It is about 65MB and it will take a very long time.)  Once
downloaded, click on the icon to unpack it and to mount the disk
image.  Open the disk image and click on the "TeXGSInstaller" icon.
This opens a window with several buttons.

<P>
<OL>
<LI> Select "Letter Paper
Size" (top left) so your printing will be properly configured for US-
type page printing.
<LI> Click "Install and initialize TeX". At this
point you will need to enter your "superuser/administrator"
password. Do this and wait for the installation to complete.
<LI>Click on "Install GhostScript".  When this is done, close all windows
and exit the installer.  To use teTeX from the command line, add the
line
</OL>

<PRE>
/usr/local/teTeX/bin/powerpc-apple-darwin-current
</PRE>

to your PATH in your .schrc file.  If such a file does not exist in your home
directory, create it and add the line:

<PRE>
setenv PATH"$PATH:/usr/local/teTeX/bin/powerpc-apple-darwin-current"
</PRE>

<P>
Note: If your machine is runnig OS X version 10.2 (the very latest 
version called Jaguar) you should install the TeX programs using Wierda's
dedicated TeX i-Installer.app from the above mentioned site or else
you may not be able to run all the TeX  packages from the
Terminal.app command line.  If you will do all your texing using
TeXShop, ignore this comment.

<P>
If all went well above (and it should have), teTeX should now
be working.  Open a terminal and test it with a file by typing

<PRE>
tex file.tex
</PRE>

<P>
or
<tt>latex file.tex</tt> or <tt>pdflatex file.tex</tt>, etc.
At this point you still need to be able to "see" your math formulas
after the file has been texed.


<H2>
Installing a Tex Previewer
</H2>

<P>
There are several solutions for this now. Perhaps the simplest
(and a very nice one as well) is TexShop,
written by Richard Koch, Professor of Mathematics at the University of
Oregon, and given to the texing world for free.  This is an editor and
previewer for teTeX.  It runs the "dflatex" or "pdftex" command to
produce the "ps", "dvi" and "pdf" files all at once. It displays the
"pdf" file. It is found at
<A HREF="http://www.uoregon.edu/~koch/texshop/texshop.html">
http://www.uoregon.edu/~koch/texshop/texshop.html</A>
Once in your machine, click on it to unzip
it, if it did not unzip automatically after the download.  Move the
folder to your "Applications" folder/directory. Click on the TeXShop
icon, open a file, and press the "tex" or "latex" button to tex it.
For more information and instructions on how to use and configure
TeXShop, see Professor Koch's webpage.

<H2>
Dvi and Postscript files
</H2>

<P>
If you have a dvi or postscript file but
no tex source file, open it with TeXShop.  This will convert it to a
pdf file and will open the pdf file automatically.  If there are eps
figures in the file, use "TeX and GhostScript" from the "typeset" menu
in TeXShop so that the figures are properly displayed.  If you want a
dvi viewer and a postscript viewer, download them from
<A HREF="http://www.kiffe.com/textools.html">
http://www.kiffe.com/textools.html</A>.  The installation instructions
are there.

<H2>
Xwindows
</H2>

<P>
The whole "xwindows" system (XFree86) has been ported to
Mac OS-X. It is called "XDarwin". It is now packaged in such a way
that it is remarkably easy to install.  It runs side by side with Aqua.
With this you can run xdvi, gv, xfig, xemacs and many other unix/linux
x-applications, as well as many of the unix-linux window managers such
as icewm (popular in the math department) and even GNOME and KDE.  For
information on XDarwin and related matters, see
<A HREF="http://mrcla.com/XonX">http://mrcla.com/XonX</A>
and
<A HREF="http://fink.sourceforge.net/index.php">
http://fink.sourceforge.net/index.php</A>. This approach is perhaps
the best solution but it is a little (an epsilon) more difficult to
install and configure than just installing teTex.

<H2>
Keeping your TeX up-to-date
</H2>

<P>
The above tex distribution for OS-X
(kindly prepared and maintained by Gerben Wierda) is based on the so
called "TeXLive-teTeX" distribution which is very much up-to-date with
many packages which you will probably never need or ever use. To keep
your TeX installation current, download the "TeX-i-installer" from
Wierda's site
<A HREF="http://www.rna.nl/tex.html">
http://www.rna.nl/tex.html</A> and periodically check for
updates. This i-installer automatically downloads and installs
Wierda's new releases of teTeXLive. The instructions on running the
i-installer are fairly simple.  Click on "check for new package versions
available" and follow the instructions. With a fast internet
connection it takes just a few minutes to keep your system current.

<H2>
Mac Security
</H2>

<P>
A Mac running OS-X is not an ordinary Mac: The
default (factory) installation of Mac OS-X provides a fully
functional, multiuser, Unix Server.  It is powerful and dangerous at
the same time as it runs many services which can potentially present
security problems if your Mac is connected to the internet 100% of the
time on some local network or via DSL/cable modem at home. This is
particularly critical if your Mac has a fixed IP address, as is the
case if you use the Purdue resnet service and you don't have a router
which automatically shuts off these services.  Services that OS-X runs
(or can run) include "ssh server", "apache webserver", "telnet server",
"rlogin server", "finger server", "ftp server", "Apple Talk server",
and several others.  Most of these services can be turned on by going
to "System Preferences" then to "sharing".  Some others need to be
turned on in certain .config files in the "/etc" directory, but unless
you know what you are doing, I do not recommend messing with those
files. You can do yourself more harm than good!  To check which "ports"
are open and to see some of the services running on your Mac, go to
"Network Utility" then to "Port Scan", enter the name of your machine,
and scan for open ports.  I recommend closing everything except
possibly the ssh-server if you need to log into your machine while
you are away from "home".  The ssh server also runs a secured ftp
server and can forward x-applications.  To learn about ftp via ssh,
type "man scp" and "man sftp" in a terminal window.  The files that
configure the ssh-client and the ssh-server are in the "/etc"
directory.  Again, I do not recommend messing with these files unless
you know what you are doing.  Finally, it is extremely important, from
what I read in security news groups, to maintain your ssh (client and
server) up-to-date.  Using an outdated ssh for which all the bugs and
security holes have been well advertised and documented is worse than
not using ssh at all.  This applies to all ssh users on any system.  As
of this writing, the latest "openssh" (OpenSSH-3.4p1) was released
June 26, 2002.  I suggest running "software update", from "system
preferences", periodically.  Thus far Apple has been fairly good with
security updates (I think).  Also, check
<A HREF="http://www.openssh.org">
http://www.openssh.org</A> for new
releases.
