How to create .pdf files from TeX
</H1>

<P>

Click on <B>RELOAD</B> now.  This page is frequently updated and
you might be looking at an old version saved by your netscape cache.

<P>
Here is the easiest way to create a PDF file from a TeX file.  Suppose
you have a TeX file called

<P>
<tt>something.tex</tt>

<P>
First, tex the file by typing

<P>
<tt>
amstex something.tex<br>
</tt>

<P>
if it is in AMS-TeX, or

<P>
<tt>
latex something.tex<br>
</tt>

<P>
(twice) if it is in LaTeX.  These commands create a file called

<P>
<tt>something.dvi</tt>

<P>
To convert this DVI file into a PDF file, type

<P>
<tt>
dvipdf something.dvi
</tt>

<P>
This will create the file

<P>
<tt>something.pdf</tt>

<P>
You can view this PDF file by typing

<P>
<tt>
acroread something.pdf
</tt>

<P>
Another way to create PDF from DVI uses a couple extra commands:

<P>
<tt>
dvips -Pweb something.dvi<br>
distill something.ps<br>
rm something.ps<br>
</tt>

<P>
The first command creates a large PostScript file called <tt>something.ps</tt>
and the second command creates a file called <tt>something.pdf</tt>

<P>
NOTE:

This page is rather outdated.  The new Linux servers support
the commands <tt>pdflatex</tt> and <tt>pdftex</tt> that create
a PDF file directly from the TeX source file.  If you run TeX
to create a DVI file, you can then run <tt>dvipdf</tt>, which
will create a PDF file from the DVI file.  There is also
<tt>ps2pdf</tt> that will convert a PostScript file to PDF.

<P>
<HR>

<P>
The last command removes the overly large PostScript file.

<P>
If you have embedded eps graphics in your TeX output,
these should get converted to pdf nicely by either method
above.  If you are happy with this, stop reading.  However,
if you want hyperlinks, bookmarks, embedded jpg
files, etc., read on.

How to compile source to pdf
</H1>

<P>
It's possible to compile tex or latex straight into pdf,
and this typically results in a richer document.  Unfortunately,
the default version of the <tt>pdflatex</tt> command is broken
(at least for complicated documents).  Before you do anything
else, set the newer version of tex as default by adding these lines:

<P>
<PRE>
set path = (/pkgs/teTeX-2.0/bin/sparc-sun-solaris2.9/  $path)
setenv TEXMF /pkgs/teTeX-2.0/texmf/
</PRE>

<P>
in your <tt>.cshrc</tt> to be executed automatically
next time you log in.  (This is assuming you use the standard shells,
csh or tcsh.)

<P>
Now you are ready to type:

<P>
<tt>
pdftex something.tex
</tt>

<P>
for plain or AMS-TeX, or

<P>
<tt>
pdflatex something.tex
</tt>

<P>
(twice) for latex. These commands create <tt>something.pdf</tt>

<P>
<H3>
A few additional notes:
</H3>

<P>
If you want hyperlinks, try putting

<P>
<tt>
\usepackage{hyperref}
</tt>

<P>
into your latex file.

<P>
One small annoyance about pdflatex is that it can't handle
eps graphics.  The solution is to convert eps files to pdf first
by typing

<P>
<tt>
epstopdf picture.eps
</tt>

<P>
for each embedded graphic.  If you use the "graphicx" package,
then change all references of

<P>
<tt>
\includegraphics{picture.eps}
</tt>

<P>
to

<P>
<tt>
\includegraphics{picture}
</tt>
