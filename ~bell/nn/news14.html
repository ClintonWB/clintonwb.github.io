How to make your Purdue Career e-mail account functional.

<p>
When you get a new <tt>purdue.edu</tt> account as a new student or faculty
member, your e-mail address is set to REJECT email to the e-mail
address <tt>user@purdue.edu</tt>.

<p>
You will need to go to the ITAP directory service and set up your
account at <tt>purdue.edu</tt> to either accept e-mail or to forward it
to another address.  Most <tt>math.purdue.edu</tt> users forward their
e-mail to the <tt>purdu.edu</tt> address to go to their accout at
<tt>math.purdue.edu</tt>.

<P>
To make the change,

<P>
<UL>
<LI> Open the website,
<A href="http://www.itap.purdue.edu/directory/">http://www.itap.purdue.edu/directory/</a>
<LI> Click on <B>Update your Directory Listing</B> icon.
<LI> Enter your Purdue Career Account username and password.
<LI> Click on the word <B>Change service</B> on the right hand side.
<LI> Click on the delivery service menu and follow the directions.
<LI>Change the default <tt>reject</tt> to <tt>forward</tt> and click on
<b>OK</B>.
<LI> Be sure to fill in your full e-mail address, e.g.,
<tt>user@math.purdue.edu</tt> and click on <b>OK</b>.
</UL>

<P>
You can also set up a Mail*Hub alias for yourself.  I could set mine to
be <tt>dingdong</tt>.  This means that someone can e-mail me as

<P>
<tt>dingdong@purdue.edu</tt>

<P>
and (since I set my service to forward) it automatically
gets forwarded to <tt>myuserid@math.purdue.edu</tt>.

<P>
It also happens that you have a long e-mail address at Purdue like

<P>
<TT>
firstname.middleinitial.lastname.number@purdue.edu
</TT>

<P>
I found out what mine was by typing

<P>
<tt>
ph mylastname myfirstname
</tt>

<P>
at a prompt on a math dept SUN (or you can find yours at the URL below).

<P>
If your students look you up on the ph system and e-mail to this
monstrosity, it will now be forwarded to you at math (provided you have
set your service to forward).

<P>

<P>
Donu Arapura has also written up a nice little description of
how you can use the Purdue Mail*Hub as a convenient way to do
e-mail from home by settin your <tt>service</tt> to be <tt>store</tt>.
