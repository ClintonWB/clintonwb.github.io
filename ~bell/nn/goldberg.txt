NEW VERSION OF MATLAB    9/14/2001

We recently updated our UNIX system so that Matlab 6
is the default version.  In order to run this version
of MATLAB, you must be on a machine operating on
Solaris 2.8, which many of our machines are not.  You
can run the latest version by taking the following steps:

1) In an x-term window type

xon banach

This will open an x-window on banach with the display
directed back to your machine.

2)  type "matlab" in the new window.  This will open a
separate matlab workspace window.  It will look essentially
identical to the version on all PUCC machines on campus.

If you wish to run the previous version of MATLAB, you
can do so by typing "/pkgs/matlab-5.3.1/bin/matlab" in any
x-term (you don't need to be on banach).  

If there are any problems with matlab, or its compatibility
with the version supported by PUCC, please bring them to my
attention, and I will try to have the situation corrected.
