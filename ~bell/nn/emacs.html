<H2>Pros.</H2>

<OL>
<LI>
Under the X-interface, you can select text or basic commands with the
mouse (unlike vi).
<LI>
Until you save the file you're editing, all actions are reversible. And
it saves a back up (ending with ~) just in case you really screw up.
<LI>
It's very powerful. Not only can it  be used to edit files, but also to
read mail, read news, and run other programs (e.g. TeX, shells...) and parse
the output or error messages in some useful way.
<LI>
It's customizable in the extreme. More about that later.
</OL>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
<H2>Cons.</H2>

</OL>
<LI>
It can be slow, especially on an old machine.  However, emacs can be
run remotely on a faster machine. Also it's a good idea to have only one
copy of emacs running for as long as you think you need it.
<LI>
It has a reputation of being hard to use. Part of this stems from the
fact that emacs traditionally required users to memorize a long list of
complicated key combinations. Under the X-interface however, this is not so
critical.
</OL>

<H2>
Basics and Some Terminology.
</H2>

<P>
Usually, emacs is invoked by typing "emacs", or "emacs &" (if you use
solaris, you may need to fiddle with your path first). To edit a file select
"open file" from the menu, to save it select "save buffer", type Control-g to
cancel a previous command, and select "exit emacs"  to quit.

<P>
<B>Buffers:</B> A buffer is a copy of the file that you are editing. Until you
actually save the buffer, you can undo commands many times. Emacs can
handle several buffers simultaneously - which is why you won't need to run
multiple emacs's.

<P>
<B>Minibuffer:</B> The strip along the bottom of emacs. For certain commands
such as searches, you may be required to type information into it.

<P>
<B>Modes:</B> Emacs is modal in the sense that it "knows" about many different
kinds of files (TeX files, shell scripts, C programs, html files...),
and will change behaviour accordingly.

<P>
<HR>

<P>
<H2>Invoking Commands from Keyboard.</H2>

<P>
Some commands cannot be accessed through a menu, but ALL
commands can be invoked from the keyboard. Unfortunately, this is
where emacs gets its bad reputation. Emacs often uses multiple key
combinations where some keys have to be "modified" by also pressing
the control  or esc keys first. A complete list can be found under
"List Keybindings" of the help menu ( "C-" and "M-" means control
and esc). A brief list: quit (C-x C-c), save buffer (C-x C-s), open file
(C-x C-f), search forward (C-s), search backward (C-r),
cancel last command (C-g).

<P>
On Sun keyboards, keys labeled "page up", "undo", "cut"... should have
the expected meanings.

<P>
It's possible to define your own key bindings in your .emacs file.
See below.

<P>
<HR>

<P>
<H2>More Help.</H2>

<P>
There's considerable help from within emacs itself (obviously under
the help menu). Beyond that,there are news groups, a number of
resources on the web, and even a book or two. If all else fails and
you need to curse, try M-x doctor

<P>
<HR>

<P>
<H2>TeX Modes.</H2>

<P>
Emacs comes prebuilt with a basic tex mode, but there is a more refined
one called AUC-TeX that I've installed in my directory (but can used by
anyone, as I'll explain below).  In these modes, you get visual clues
about the correctness of your file: balancing of $'s, braces..., and
(optional) colour coding. TeX or LaTeX can be run directly under
these modes. In the case of AUC-TeX,  emacs can parse the error
messages and  go directly to the offending lines of the appropriate
source files.

<P>
<HR>

<P>
<H2>Customization.</H2>

<P>
<H2>1. X resources.</H2>

<P>
The external appearance of anything running under X can be set in an
initialization file such as .Xdefaults. To increase the size of the fonts
that emacs uses, you can append <A HREF="./arapura.txt">THESE LINES</A> to your
.Xdefaults file, or another way to copy these lines to the end of your
.Xdefaults file is to type:

<P>
<tt>
cd<br>
cat .Xdefaults ~dvb/pub/sample.Xdefaults > tempXdefaults<br>
mv -f tempXdefaults .Xdefaults
</tt>

<P>
<H2>2. .emacs</H2>

<P>
When emacs starts up, it reads a file in your directory called .emacs (if
it exists). This file can make emacs do pretty much anything. It is in fact
a lisp program, so it requires a little know-how to create from scratch.
I've written a  <A HREF="./emacs.txt">sample .emacs file</A> that you can
download here or you can copy it from my account via UNIX by typing

<P>
<tt>
cp ~dvb/pub/sample.emacs .emacs
</tt>

<P>
then modify it to suite your taste. It's set up to invoke AUC-TEX and
colour coding. If you want to make changes, the main thing to keep
in mind is that a sentence in lisp looks like  (...), and anything
to the right of a semicolon is treated as a comment.

<H2>
ADDENDUM, 9/22/99
</H2>

<P>
We have now installed AUC-tex system-wide for the new emacs
(which is at /pkgs/gnu/bin/emacs for both older SunOS 
and newer Solaris machines).  So if you use that and
remove

<P>
<tt>
(setq load-path (cons "~dvb/elisp" load-path))
</tt>

<P>
and just leave

<P>
<tt>
(require 'tex-site)
</tt>

<P>
in your .emacs, you should be OK.

<H2>

<HR>
ADDENDUM, 1/29/02
</H2>

<P>
Check out this <A HREF="http://www.math.purdue.edu/~dvb/xdvi.html">New
version of xdvi</A> that connects to the emacs editor for interactive
TeX viewing and editting.
