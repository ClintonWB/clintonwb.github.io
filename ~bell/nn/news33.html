I taught MATH 165 in Math 175 this past fall using an IBM X-41
ThinkPad Tablet PC.  The students said they liked it better
than the dual overhead projectors or the three shuffled blackboards.
It also made it very easy to post my lecture notes on the web.
I explain here how I set it all up.

<P>
First, I went to the University Book Store and bought a ten
foot VGA extension cord for ten bucks.  I plugged one end
into the monitor cable that only reaches two feet beyond the
computer station in Math 175 and I plugged the other end into
the side of my tablet PC, which I placed on the lectern that
I put on the table that I slid over toward the aisle closest
to the computer station.

<P>
I put my tablet PC to sleep before lecture.  When I got to
Math 175, I plugged everything in, then turned on the projector.
After the projector warmed up, I selected RGB-2 for the
input to the projector and then fired up my tablet PC in
regular laptop mode.  When the laptop was ready, I pushed
Fn-F7 to set up an external monitor and selected

<P>
<tt>Presentation on projector and ThinkPad XGA 1024x728</tt>

<P>
Next, I would fire up Windows Journal.  After that, I wanted
to turn the ThinkPad laptop into a tablet PC by rotating
the screen and closing it down.  When I did that, the image
from the projector would turn upside down.  To correct this,
I pushed the rotate 90 degrees button on the right side of
the tablet twice.  (Don't push it twice too fast.  It might
hang up.  I explain at the end of this page how you can
change the orientation order for that button so that you
will only need to push it once here.)  Now I could begin
my lecture.  I explain in the
next paragraph how I set up Windows Journal to function nicely
as a multiple colored pen overhead projector.  (Before I do
that, I should mention that not all ItaP interfaces to
projectors work the same.  In REC 317, for example, I had
to plug in my sleeping laptop and make sure the input to
the projector was on RGB-1, which projects the screen from
the desktop in the classroom.  Then I would wake up my laptop
and select presentation mode.  Then I would switch to RGB-2
to get the tablet output to the screen.  Any other order
would fail.)

<P>
Windows Journal has an annoying feature of jumping to the
next page when you start getting close to the bottom of a
page.  To avoid this, I create a Windows Journal document
called <tt>lecture.jnt</tt> that is ten pages long with only one
little dot in the bottom corner of each page.  I keep it
on my desktop.  That way I can double click on it and start
writing and just scroll past the bottom of each page without
the jump, just like an overhead projector with a roller of
plastic film.  At the end of the lecture, I save it as
<tt>lecture03-21.jnt</tt>. (if the date is 03-21-2009, for
example).  I delete any blank pages at the end so students
won't waste paper printing them.

<P>
I like to use an 8.5x11 inch wide ruled note paper
style for my paper.  That way, if my students decide
to save my lecture notes from the web, they will print
nicely.

<P>
The tablet screen gets projected so large on the screen
in class that you can write as small as you can and the
students in back can read it just fine.  So I set my pen
to have the finest thickness possible, fine chisel.  I
only want the color menu bar to appear at the top of the
page, so I go to the <tt>View</tt> menu and select
<tt>Toolbars</tt> and check the <tt>Format</tt> setting
and uncheck the <tt>Pen</tt>, <tt>Standard</tt>, and
<tt>View</tt> settings.  (I save the file once after
that to <tt>lecture.jnt</tt> so I don't have to do it
every time before lecture.)

<P>
It is easy to change the color of the ink now by just
tapping on the color box at the top of the screen.  (I
made the best picture of the complex cosine function
I've ever done in MA 530 using six different colors
this way.)

<P>
The best way to post your lectures on the web is to
PRINT the Windows Journal file to a fake printer called
Adobe PDF converter (which gets installed in your printer
list when you install Adobe Standard).  When you print
to Adobe PDF converter, it will give you a dialogue box
asking you where you want to save the PDF file.
See some <A HREF="../MA527/Lectures">examples</A> here.

<P>
Another way to post the lecture notes on the web is to
go to the <tt>File</tt> menu and select <tt>Export</tt>
and export the file to <tt>lecture03-21.mht</tt> in
Windows Web Archive format.  See some
<A HREF="http://www.math.purdue.edu/~bell/MA530/Lectures">
examples.</A>

<P>
There is also a free Windows program to view
Windows Journal Files, so you can even post the
notes as <tt>lecture03-21.jnt</tt> in Windows
Journal format and your students can easily view
them if they download the free program from
microsoft.com.

<P>
If your students are mac users, they will need
a plug-in to view Windows Web Archive files.  If
you have Adobe Acrobat Standard, you can also save
the Windows Journal file as a TIFF file and use
Adobe Acrobat to convert it to PDF, but you'll lose
the colors that way.  See this
<A HREF="http://www.math.purdue.edu/~bell/MA181/trapezoid-rule.pdf">
example</A> for how a PDF file turns out this way.

<P>
You can change the order in which the rotate
button changes the screen orientation so that
you don't have to push it multiple times to
get the output displayed correctly on an
exterior monitor.  To do this, go to Tools
in Windows Journal and select Options.  Clik
on the Other tab and click on Tablet Settings
in the lower right corner.  You'll see a link
at the bottom of the Display tab that says
Go to orientation.  There you can mess around
with the order until you get it right.

<P>
Let me know if you have a better system.  If
you have Microsoft Office installed, you might
like to try the OpenNote program.  It is a
fancier version of Windows Journal that handles
image files better.

<P>
Another nifty thing you might like to try is
<B>Jing</B>, an application to capture what is
happening on your computer screen with voice
over in a Flash video.  It is a free download at
