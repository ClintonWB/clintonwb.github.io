How to trim an e-mail alias
</H1>

<P>
The <tt>faculty</tt> e-mail alias has a lot more people on
it than you might imagine.  (To find out who is actually on
the <tt>faculty</tt> e-mail alias list, type

<P>
<PRE>
ldaplist -l aliases faculty
</PRE>

<P>
at a UNIX prompt, and then <tt>cat</tt> the file that you see
near the bottom of the output.  If that doesn't work, try

<P>
<PRE>
ldapsearch -x -b ou=aliases,dc=math,dc=purdue,dc=edu cn=faculty
</PRE>

<P>
to find the file.)

<P>
I know who is on the faculty alias, and I almost always
want to e-mail to a subset of that august body.  To do that,
I simply copy and paste that part of the faculty alias I
want to e-mail to the file that contains my e-mail aliases.

<P>
For example, if I use <tt>elm</tt>, I might add the lines

<P>
<PRE>
wiseguys = The over 50 crowd = ram,becker,brkld,lgb,catlin,
  cowen,branges,hgd,douglas,drasin,agabriel,gottlieb,heinzer,
  jjp,jspw,lempert,lipman,lipshitz,ttm,neug,rcp,shahidi,
  tong,smw,weits,wilker,ecz
</PRE>

<P>
to my <tt>aliases.text</tt> file which resides in the <tt>.elm</tt>
subdirectory of my home directory.  Notice that space at the first
postition of the continuation lines.  (I rarely add myself to
an alias to which I may or may not be an actual member.)

<P>
Note: After you add a new alias to your <tt>.elm/aliases.text</tt>
file, you will need to run the <tt>newalias</tt> command for it
to take hold.

<P>
If I use <tt>pine</tt>, I would add the lines

<P>
<PRE>
wiseguys     The over 50 crowd      (ram,becker,brkld,lgb,catlin,
   cowen,branges,hgd,douglas,drasin,agabriel,gottlieb,heinzer,
   jjp,jspw,lempert,lipman,lipshitz,ttm,neug,rcp,shahidi,
   tong,smw,weits,wilker,ecz)
</PRE>

<P>
to my file <tt>.addressbook</tt> which resides in my home directory.
Those are TABs between the <tt>wiseguys</tt> alias name and <tt>"The
over 50 crowd"</tt> comment and between <tt>"The over 50 crowd"</tt>
and the comma separated address list, which is enclosed by parantheses.
The continuation lines must begin with a blank space.

<P>
If I use the old standard <tt>mail</tt> command (which I really
shouldn't), I would add <I>one big long line</I> like this

<P>
<tt>
wiseguys ram becker brkld lgb catlin cowen branges hgd douglas drasin agabriel gottlieb heinzer jjp jspw lempert lipman lipshitz ttm neug rcp shahidi tong smw weits wilker ecz
</tt>

<P>
to my <tt>.mailrc</tt> file in my home directory.  Notice that the
commas have been replaced by spaces, and it is all one line.  You
could add the comment line

<P>
<tt>
# The over 50 crowd
</tt>

<P>
right after this list line.  (Comments must begin with the # character at
the first position in the .mailrc)

<H2>
Other tidbits about e-mail aliases and unix groups.
</H2>

<P>
If you log onto the machine <tt>newton</tt>, you can find
all the current departmental e-mail aliases in the file
<tt>/etc/aliases</tt>

<P>
To find out what unix groups the user <tt>bell</tt> (that's me)
belongs to, type

<P>
<tt>
groups bell
</tt>

<P>
To find out who belongs to the <tt>office</tt> unix group, type

<P>
<tt>
ypmatch office group
</tt>

<P>
That's all for now.
