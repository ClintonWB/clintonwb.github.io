How to handle .pdf files on the web: acroread, distill, and Netscape
</H1>

<P>
<HR>

Click on <B>RELOAD</B> now.  This page is frequently updated and
you might be looking at an old version saved by your netscape cache.

<P>
<HR>

This page is rather outdated.  The new Linux servers support
the commands <tt>pdflatex</tt> and <tt>pdftex</tt> that create
a PDF file directly from the TeX source file.  If you run TeX
to create a DVI file, you can then run <tt>dvipdf</tt>, which
will create a PDF file from the DVI file.  There is also
<tt>ps2pdf</tt> that will convert a PostScript file to PDF.

<P>
The information below used to work nicely on the Solaris SUN system.

<P>
<HR>

<P>
The math department has installed the program Acrobat in order
to allow users to display and view things like TeX output on the web.
I shall explain how to use the Acrobat software and how to display
TeX output on the web.

<P>
To appreciate what I am talking about, try to see the old qualifer
exams that are posted on our math dept home page at
<A HREF="http://www.math.purdue.edu/academics/oldExams/">
Old Exams.</A>

<P>
The department is now displaying old qualifier exams on the web in the form
of  <B>.pdf</B>  files.  PDF (<B>P</B>ortable <B>D</B>ocument <B>F</B>ormat)
files have names like <tt>ma530.pdf</tt> and they can be viewed with the
"acroread" command.  I shall explain how to use the sequence of commands

<P>
<tt>
amstex file.tex<br>
dvips -Pweb file.dvi<br>
distill file.ps<br>
rm file.ps<br>
acroread file.pdf &
</tt>

<P>
to create and view PDF files below.

<P>
The first thing you will need to do is to make sure that Acrobat
is in your path.  (It should be there by default.)  Type

<P>
<tt>
which acroread
</tt>

<P>
If the output of this command is

<P>
<tt>
no acroread in .....
</tt>

<P>
then you need to look at these instructions on
<A HREF="./acrobat.html">how to add Acrobat to your path.</A>

<HR>

TeX on the web
</H2>

<P>
Here is an explanation of how to place TeX'ed material on your web
pages.

<P>
Let's say I have an old MATH 262 final exam called <tt>final.tex</tt>
that I want to display on my home page.  First I would use
<tt>tex</tt> or <tt>amstex</tt> or <tt>latex</tt> to TeX the file.
For example

<P>
<tt>
amstex final.tex
</tt>

<P>
Next, I would prepare a special PostScript version of the file
suitable for conversion to a .pdf file like this:

<P>
<tt>
dvips -Pweb final.dvi
</tt>

<P>
This last command creates the file <tt>final.ps</tt> which
I would next use to create the .pdf file using the <I>distill</I>
command (which is part of the Acrobat package).

<P>
<tt>
distill final.ps
</tt>

<P>
This last command creates the file <tt>final.pdf</tt> which you
can view by typing

<P>
<tt>
acroread final.pdf
</tt>

<P>
(If you use <tt>latex</tt>, and all you want is a PDF file
for output, you can bypass the dvips command altogether
by typing simply,

<P>
<tt>
pdflatex final.tex
</tt>

<P>
This command creates final.pdf without creating the intermediate
.ps file.)


<P>
To display this old final on my web page, I would move the files

<P>
<tt>
final.tex<BR>
final.dvi<BR>
final.ps<BR>
final.pdf
</tt>

<P>
to my WWW directory and type

<P>
<tt>
chmod og+r final.*
</tt>

<P>
to make the files readable to the outside world.

<P>
Finally, I would add the following lines to my Welcome.html
home page file (or to my math262.html file).

<P>
<PRE>
<tt>
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A HREF="./final.ps"&gt;Final Exam&lt;/A&gt; in PostScript format
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A HREF="./final.dvi"&gt;The same exam&lt;/A&gt; in .dvi format
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A HREF="./final.tex"&gt;The same exam&lt;/A&gt; in tex
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A HREF="./final.pdf"&gt;The same exam&lt;/A&gt; in .pdf format
&lt;/UL&gt;

&lt;P&gt;
Go to
&lt;A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/readstep.html"&gt;
http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/readstep.html&lt;/A&gt;
to download the free Acrobat program for viewing .pdf files.
</tt>
</PRE>

<P>
Here's that last link again for you to follow in case you want to install
Acrobat at home:

<P>
<A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/readstep.html">Download
Adobe Acrobat Reader</A> for free.<BR>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
You can also edit PDF files using the Acro-Exchange program.  The
command is

<P>
<tt>
acroexh
</tt>

<P>
This is very handy if you want to glue two PDF files into one
PDF file.

<P>
<HR>

<B>REMARKS:</B>
The PostScript file generated by the <tt>dvips -Pweb final.dvi</tt>
command can be rather large because it contains whole fonts and
lots of other extra junk.  If you want a smaller PostScript version
of the exam to post on the web, I would remove the file <tt>final.ps</tt>
that was created by the <tt>dvips -Pweb</tt> command and then type

<P>
<tt>dvips -f final.dvi > final.ps</tt>


<P>
Rodrigo Ba&ntilde;uelos points out that one can even import pictures
into PDF-TeX documents in other formats such as pdf, jpg or tif
provided one uses <tt>pdflatex</tt> or <tt>pdftex</tt> to go directly
from the tex file to a pdf file.  With lots of pictures
(actual photos for example), if one imports the files in
jpg format, this seems to produce much smaller pdf
files than what one would get by changing the pictures
to eps format, producing the dvi file, then the ps file,
and then the pdf file with distiller.  (Unfortunately it
appears that you cannot do this using the Math Department
tex since it seems to have an old version of pdftex.)
See Network News <A HREF="./news7.html">Volume 7</A>
for information about putting figures in TeX documents.
