I explain here how I use <tt>maple</tt> to respond to an e-mail
query like the one below:

To: bell@math.purdue.edu
From: goober@cartoon.ecn.purdue.edu
Subject: HELP!!!!

For the last 72 hours I have been trying to solve the equation
x y' + y = 1.  I'm beginning to think that it doesn't have a
solution.  Please help me!!!

Jimmy Goober

P.S.  My roomate wants me to ask you what the integral
of x^2 sin(7x) is.

<P>
I shall now dispose of these questions in a few simple keystrokes.
First, I start an e-mail message to Mr. Goober in an xterm using
an editor like vi.  Then I fire up <tt>maple</tt> in another
xterm by typing

<P>
<PRE>
maple
</PRE>

<P>
NOTE: That's <tt>maple</tt>, not xmaple.  I want the ASCII terminal version
of maple for this task.

<P>
After I type maple, I see

Next I type the following commands at the &gt; prompt.

<P>
To answer Mr. Goober in a prompt and courteous fashion, I shall click
with my left mouse button at the start of a portion of maple output
that I want to copy to my e-mail and then I shall click with the right
mouse button at the end of the text to select it.  Then I shall click
with the middle mouse button while in input mode of vi in my e-mail to
insert the selected text from maple in the e-mail.  (If you're a
dexterous mouser, you can left mouse click and drag over the text to
select it ---and then right mouse click to adjust the ending point.)

<P>
Note: If you use vi, you'll want to set your <I>wrapmargin</I> to zero
before you glob text into your file with the middle mouse button.
To do this, simply type

<P>
<tt>
:set wm=0
</tt>

<P>
in command mode of vi.

Here is the result of my efforts:

Dear Mr. Goober,

Notice that you can divide your ODE by x to obtain

                              dy
                              --  + y/x = 1/x ,
                              dx

a first order linear ODE in standard form.  The integrating factor
will be
                                         /
                                        |
                            u(x) = exp( |  1/x dx ) = x .
                                        |
                                       /

Use this as in Section 1.3 of B & D to get the solution in the
back of the book.

See you in class on Monday?

P.S. Tell your roomate
