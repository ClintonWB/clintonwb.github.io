<P>
<H1>
You and your .forward file
</H1>

<P>
Let's say your name is Steven Bellisandagorapahockey
and your login id on math is <tt>sbellis</tt> and you want
the e-mail you get on your math account to get forwarded
to an account you like better, say

<P>
<tt>
thebigkahuna@gmail.com
</tt>

<P>
Just create a file called  <tt>.forward</tt>  in your home directory
on math containing the single line

<P>
<tt>thebigkahuna@gmail.com</tt>

<P>
and the e-mail that comes to  <tt>sbellis@math.purdue.edu</tt>  will
automatically get forwarded to <tt>thebigkahuna@gmail.com</tt>.
You won't see a trace of it on your math account.  It will all end
up at your gmail account.

<P>
If you want a copy of the e-mail that comes to math to stay
at math AND get forwarded to <tt>thebigkahuna</tt>, you can put these
lines in your math  <tt>.forward</tt>  file:

<P>
<PRE>
\sbellis
thebigkahuna@gmail.com
</PRE>

<P>
(The "\" is important.  It prevents an infinite loop of e-mail
forwarding.)

<P>
If you are going away and you want to respond to all your
e-mail with an automated "I'll read your message when I get
back" message, just type

<P>
<tt>vacation</tt>

<P>
at a UNIX prompt and follow the instrucitons.  The vacation
program will create a <tt>.vacation.msg</tt> file and a <tt>.forward</tt> file
in your home directory.  The <tt>.forward</tt> file will look like this:

<P>
<tt>\sbellis, "|/usr/bin/vacation sbellis"</tt>

<P>
If you want to give an automated vacation response, keep a
copy of all your incoming e-mail at math, and forward another
copy to your gmail account, just edit the <tt>.forward</tt> file to
read

<P>
<PRE>
\sbellis, "|/usr/bin/vacation sbellis"
thebigkahuna@gmail.com
</PRE>

<P>
Don't forget to move or delete your .forward file when you return.

<P>
If you don't like the sound of your e-mail address at math, you can set up
an alias that you like better at the Purdue MAIL*HUB.  For example,
<tt>sbellis@math.purdue.edu</tt>  could set up an address of

<P>
<tt>
kahuna@purdue.edu</tt>

<P>
He could then arrange for mail that is sent to  <tt>kahuna@purdue.edu</tt>
to get forwarded to  <tt>sbellis@math.purdue.edu</tt>.
See <A HREF="./news14.html">Network News 14</A> for an
explanation of how to set up this service at the Purdue Mail Hub.

<P>
By the way, the spam filter at the Purdue Mail Hub is better than
alligate, and gmail's filter is better yet.  I once set up a triple
filter for my math mail by forwarding my math mail to my Purdue Mail
Hub account and then forwarding the mail from there to my gmail account.
It was almost crystal clear when it got to gmail.  I gave this system
up, however, because my spam reports would get tagged as spam and
it became very difficult to retrieve messages that alligate snagged
as spam that weren't really spam.

<P>
You can get free e-mail accounts at many places, including

<P>
<PRE>
hotmail.com
yahoo.com
gmail.com
</PRE>

<P>
That last one comes from the google people.  I have a copy of all
my e-mail forwarded to gmail so I can easily search it.  They have
a huge storage quota and I can save several years worth of e-mail
there for searching.
