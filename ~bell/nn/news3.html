How to take advantage of the newer, faster machines on our network

<P>
If you sit in front of the console of a machine that is named after
a really famous dead mathematician, then chances are your machine
is rather slow.  The department has recently added several new ULTRA
Sparcs to the system and named them after dead mathematcians who
aren't very famous or famous mathematicians that aren't very dead.
I will explain how you can take advantage of these faster machines.

<P>
I assume that you use X-windows.

<P>
Let's say that you are sitting at the console of the slow machine
<tt>lie</tt> and you want to run an <tt>xmaple</tt> window from the
faster ULTRA Sparc <tt>ahlfors</tt> but see and control the xmaple
window on the screen of <tt>lie</tt>.  Here's what you do.

<P>
On your machine (<tt>lie</tt> in this example), type

<P>
<tt>xon ahlfors</tt>

<P>
in an xterm window running on lie.  A new xterm window should
pop up with an ahlfors-% prompt.  Now when you type

<P>
<tt>xmaple &</tt>

<P>
at the ahlfors-% prompt, the xmaple window will appear on the screen
at the console of lie and you can use it in the comfort of your
own chair.  (If ahlfors can't find xmaple, you need to set your path
correctly as described in <A HREF="./news1.html">Network News, Volume 1</A>,
<I>You and your .chsrc</I>).

<P>
If you are sitting at an X-termial connected to banach or cantor, you
can do a similar thing.  Click <A HREF="./xterminal.html">HERE</A> for
more information.

<P>
By the way, a typical command in maple that runs rather slow on
the older machines is

<P>
<tt>
with(plots):<br>
animate3d(sin(2*x)*sin(2*y)*cos(t),x=0..Pi,y=0..Pi,t=0..2*Pi);
</tt>

<P>
Here is a <A HREF="./machines">LIST OF MACHINE NAMES</A> on math.  To
find a fast machine, look for a dead mathematician who is not very famous
or a famous mathematican who is not very dead.  Then rlogin to that
machine and type

<P>
<tt>uname -m</tt>

<P>
If the output of this command is <tt>sun4u</tt>, you have found yourself
an ULTRA.  (I have found the ULTRA's, morse, polya, ahlfors, macaulay,
hopf, and peano in this way.)
