<P>
The first time you try this, you'll be<BR>
prompted to add a WebEx plug-in to your<BR>
browser. This is a small program and the<BR>
download is quick and easy.

<P>
When setting up audio, I think it is<BR>
best to connect via your computer rather<BR>
than via phone dial-up. Click on the<BR>
audio/computer icon to do this. I have<BR>
found that I do not need a headset in<BR>
order to use my microphone.

<P>
Remember to mute your mic if you aren't<BR>
talking. There is a "raise your hand"<BR>
button you can use to get my attention<BR>
if things get crazy.

<P>
I usually share a Windows Journal window<BR>
with participants, but you can share your<BR>
screen with me and the participants too.<BR>
Just let me know if and when you want to<BR>
do that and I'll grant you permission (and<BR>
tell you how it's done). We can also share<BR>
a whiteboard for writing math formulas that's<BR>
very useful. Let me know if you want to try<BR>
this and I'll tell you how it's done.
