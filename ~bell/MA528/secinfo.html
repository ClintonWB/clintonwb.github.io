MA 52800-WNG   for on-campus students in Bell's main lecture
MA 52800-ONC   for on-campus students taking Bell's distance section
MA 52800-EP1   for off-campus students in the ProEd program

Note: All three sections will receive exactly the same course content
and will always have the option to watch the lectures online anytime
after the lectures have been given. The lectures are given

MWF  12:30-1:20 in WANG 2599

The WNG section can sit in WANG 2599 to see Bell give the lectures
live (but they will actually view the lectures on big-screen monitors).

The ONC section is for on-campus Purdue students who are taking
the course as a distance course. They will view the lectures
online whenever they want (after the lectures have been given).

There will be 24 seats in WANG 2563 where students in the ONC section
can view the lectures live if they wish. There are more than 70
students in the ONC section, so seats in WANG 2563 will be first come
first served. The experience will be the same as the experience for
the WNG section, but Bell will not be present in the room.

The EP1 section can only view the lectures online after they have
taken place.

Because I allow the WNG section to view lectures online, there are
always free seats in Wang 2599 for ONC students to sit in after the
first week of class. The overflow room is usually empty after the
first week of class, too.
