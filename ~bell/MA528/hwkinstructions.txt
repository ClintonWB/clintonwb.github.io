Homework instructions
---------------------

MA 528 Advanced Mathematics for Engineers and Physicists II,
Spring 2016

Text: Advanced Engineering Mathematics by Erwin Kreyszig (10th edition)

Homework requirements: Explain your answers clearly. No credit will be 
given for correct answers without explanation.

Homework will be collected weekly in BlackBoard, typically on
Wednesdays. Papers should be time-stamped by 11:59pm Eastern time.

Please, name your homework file in the form LastnameFirstname_#.pdf
where # is the homework number. So for the HW3 set I would submit a file
named

BellSteven_3.pdf

All homework problem numbers are from the text Advanced Engineering
Mathematics 10th Edition by Erwin Kreyszig.

If you have any other edition (including "International 10th Edition") 
you need to be sure that the homework problems you do match the ones 
from the US 10th edition. The US 10th edition is on reserve in both
the Math Library and the Engineering Library.

The schedule on the syllabus may be modified later.
