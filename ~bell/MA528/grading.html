<H2>Grading policies for Bell's MA 527 course</H2>

<P>
Homework will be collected once a week (usually on<BR>
Wednesday).  Only 5 problems will be graded per week.<BR>
Each problem will be worth five points and so each<BR>
homework assignment will be graded on a scale of 0<BR>
to 25.

<P>
There will be two one-hour midterm exams and one two-hour<BR>
final exam. Crib sheets in the form of one regular sized<BR>
piece of paper handwritten on both sides will be allowed <BR>
for Exams 1 and 2. Two such sheets will be allowed for the<BR>
final exam.

<P>
No notes, books, or calculators will be allowed during exams.<BR>
Each hour exam will be worth 100 points, the homework<BR>
grade will be scaled to 100 points, and the final will<BR>
be worth 150 points, making a total of 450 points for the<BR>
whole course.
