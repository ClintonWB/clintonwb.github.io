<P>
A team of mathematicians, including a Purdue
undergraduate, has found a way to transform<BR>
complicated regions in the plane into simpler
regions so that problems of analysis can be<BR>
solved via finite algebraic methods.

<P>
The Riemann Mapping Theorem states that any
sub-region in the plane without holes can<BR>
be conformally mapped to the unit disc.  Thus,
it is possible to deform a map of Indiana in<BR>
such a way that it becomes a disc and all the
roads cross at the same angles they did on<BR>
the original map.  This is a useful transformation
for running numerical analysis because the<BR>
boundary of the disc is simple, whereas the
boundary of the state is complicated.

<P>
The unit disc is an example of a double quadrature
domain: the average of an analytic function <BR>
both with respect to area measure and with respect to
boundary arc length measure give the<BR>
value at the center.

<P>
The new version of the mapping theorem applies
to regions with or without holes and states that<BR>
it is possible to conformally map such regions to
double quadrature domains that are <I>close</I> to <BR>
the original region.  Consequently, it is possible
to make subtle changes in a region so that many of<BR>
the classical problems of analysis can be solved
via algebra and finite methods, as on a disc,<BR>
rather than more difficult limiting methods.  Double
quadrature domains also have the desirable feature<BR>
that many of the objects of analysis can be "zipped"
down to a small data set consisting of finitely<BR>
many numbers.

<P>
This research sprouted from an Undergraduate
Research Project of Purdue undergraduate Zack<BR>
Sylvan that Professor Bell supervised.  The two
went on to extend the work to its present form<BR>
with Swedish quadrature domain expert, Bj&ouml;rn Gustafsson.
