maple and xmaple
</H1>

<P>
Purdue students can gain access to MAPLE through

<P>
<A HREF="http://goremote.itap.purdue.edu">Software Remote (DACS)</A>


<P>
Math Dept computer account holders can get maple to run on a math
dept SUN, by typing

<P>
<tt>
xmaple &
</tt>

<P>
in an xterm window.  They can also type just plain <tt>maple</tt> in
an xterm, but this is a more primitive non-window version of maple
that you probably won't want to use very often.  If you do type
plain maple by mistake, just type <tt>quit;</tt> to terminate
the program.

<P>
To start maple on an ItaP PC, left mouse click on the START button
and type MAPLE in the search box. I like the
<tt>Classic Maple Worksheet</tt> if it is available. Select it
and a maple window should pop up in a few seconds.

<P>
When your maple window appears, left mouse click in the big
window to put your cursor there.  Try typing this command:

<P>
<PRE>
diff( x^3 * exp(x) * sin(x) , x);
</PRE>

<P>
and push RETURN after the semicolon.  (The semicolon is important.
Maple won't ever do anything until you give it a semicolon and
then a RETURN.)

<p>
Nifty, isn't it?  Now try these (one line at a time):


<P>
<PRE>
int( x^10 * ln(x) , x);
int( exp(x) * sin(x) , x=0..2*Pi);
(x^3+3*x^2+3*x+1)*(x^2+x+1);
expand(%);
factor(%);
convert( (x^4+1)/(x^5+4*x^4+7*x^3+7*x^2+4*x+1) , parfrac , x );
solve( a*x^2+b*x+c=0 , x );
solve( { x^2+y^3=1, x+y=1} , {x,y} );
</PRE>

<P>
Note, the percent sign % above is maple shorthand for the output
of the last executed command.  Typing

<P>
<PRE>
(x^3+3*x^2+3*x+1)*(x^2+x+1);
expand(%);
</PRE>

gives the same result as typing

<P>
<PRE>
expand( (x^3+3*x^2+3*x+1)*(x^2+x+1) );
</PRE>

<P>
Now try these:

<P>
<PRE>
plot( exp(-x)*sin(3*x) , x=0..3 );
plot3d( sin(x)*sin(y) , x=0..2*Pi , y=0..2*Pi );
</PRE>

<P>
Maple can also do animated graphics.  Pull down the FILE menu
on the maple toolbar and select <tt>Preferences...</tt>.  Click
on the <tt>Plotting</tt> tab and make sure the Plotting Display
is set to Window instead of Inline.

<P>
Next, type

<P>
<PRE>
with(plots);
</PRE>

<P>
This last command loads the list of special commands that you
see dispalyed after you push RETURN.  (If you don't want to see
all those commands, type a colon after the command instead of a
semicolon.)

<P>
Now type

<P>
<PRE>
animate( sin(x)*cos(t) , x=0..2*Pi , t=0..2*Pi );
</PRE>

<P>
Notice the buttons above the graphics window that look
like the controls of a VCR.  Click on the "play" button
to run the animation through one cycle of time <tt>t</tt>.
To make the graphics run continuously, click on the far
right button (that looks like a circle with an arrow on
it) and then click on "play."

<P>
Now try

<P>
<PRE>
animate3d( sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(t) , x=0..2*Pi , y=0..2*Pi, t=0..2*Pi );
</PRE>

<P>
Did you ever wonder if Fourier Series really converge?  Try this one:

<P>
<PRE>
f := x -> sum( ((-1)^n /(2*n+1)^2 ) * sin( (2*n+1)*x ) , n=0..5);
f(Pi/4);
plot( f(x) , x=-3*Pi..3*Pi );
</PRE>

<P>
And this one:

<P>
<PRE>
f := x -> sum( (1/(2*n+1)) * sin( (2*n+1)*x ) , n=0..5);
plot( f(x) , x=-3*Pi..3*Pi );
</PRE>

<P>
Go back and position the mouse just after the <tt>5</tt> in the range
term <tt>n=0..5</tt> and push BACKSPACE and then type a bigger number
like 12 and then push RETURN, and then push RETURN again to make the
<tt>plot</tt> statement rerun.

<P>
Here is a great way to learn maple by taking advantage of the on-line
help that comes with xmaple.  Let's say you want to compute the Taylor
expansion of <tt>exp(x)*tan(x)</tt> out to order 15.  Type

<P>
<PRE>
?taylor
</PRE>

<P>
A window will pop up about the <tt>taylor</tt> command.  You can read
the computer manual style description of this command, or you can just
scroll the window down near the bottom where you will find several
examples of the command displayed.  Go ahead, scroll down and find
the first example.  Left mouse click just the to left of the first
character in the first example and hold down the left mouse button
and drag until you have highlighted the whole example command, then
release the left mouse button.  Next select COPY from the EDIT menu.
Now click with the left mouse button back at a prompt on the maple
worksheet.   If you were using a SUN workstation, you could click
with the MIDDLE mouse button and the text you hightlighted would appear
at the prompt.  On a PUCC PC, you get the same behavior by selecting
PASTE  from the EDIT menu.  Try it.  You'll get

<P>
<PRE>
taylor( exp(x), x=0 , 4 );
</PRE>

<P>
Now push RETURN and get the Taylor expansion for exp(x) about x=0 up to order 4.
It is now clear that typing

<P>
<PRE>
taylor( exp(x)*tan(x), x=0 , 15 );
</PRE>

<P>
will give us what we want.

<P>
Type

<P>
<PRE>
?conformal
</PRE>

<P>
to see some nice examples of ways to plot conformal mappings.
You'll need to type

<P>
<PRE>
with(plots):
</PRE>

<P>
before you can use the <tt>conformal</tt> command.

<P>
Now try this:

<P>
<PRE>
with(linalg);
</PRE>

<P>
This command loads a whole bunch of nice linear algebra routines.  Now you
can do this:

<P>
<PRE>
m := matrix( [  [1,2,3] , [3,2,1] , [sqrt(2),sqrt(3),Pi]  ] );
inverse(m);
</PRE>

<P>
Investigate the commands <tt>addrow</tt>, <tt>mulrow</tt>, and
<tt>swaprow</tt> using the online help.  Now try this sequence
of commands (this is how I like to teach Gaussian elimination
in MATH 262).

<P>
<PRE>
m := matrix( [   [8,2,3] , [3,2,1] , [6,6,7]  ] );
m1 := mulrow( m , 1, 1/8 );
m2 := addrow( m1, 1, 2, -3 );
m3 := addrow ( m2, 1, 3, -6 );
m4 := swaprow( m3, 2, 3 );
det(m);
inverse(m);
eigenvals(m);
eigenvects(m);
</PRE>

<P>
Maple has a large assortment of commands for solving and studying
ODE's.  Try these.

<P>
<PRE>
with(DEtools);
ODE := diff(y(x),x) = y(x)^2 + x^2;
dfieldplot( ODE , y(x), x=-1..1, y=-1..1 );
dsolve (ODE , y(x) );
dsolve ({ ODE, y(0)=0 } , y(x) );
y := rhs(%);
plot(y, x=-1..1);
y;
y:='y';
y;
</PRE>

<P>
Notice that when you define a variable like <tt>y</tt> to be
something, it is that something from that point on.  For example,
if you were to define <tt>x</tt> to be equal to <tt>t^2</tt> via
the command

<P>
<PRE>
x := t^2;
</PRE>

<P>
and then try to do this:

<P>
<PRE>
plot( sin(x), x=0..4 );
</PRE>

<P>
you would get the error message

<P>
<I>Error, (in plot) invalid arguments</I>

<P>
because <tt>x</tt> is not a free variable to range from <tt>0</tt>
to <tt>4</tt> in the plot command; it is <tt>t^2</tt>.
To <EM>undefine</EM> the variable <tt>x</tt>, you would do this:

<P>
<PRE>
x := 'x';
</PRE>

<P>
Now you can go back and position the cursor in the plot command
and push RETURN and the plot will work.  (Funny thing about MAPLE,
the commands are executed in the order that you push RETURN, and
this does not need to be the same as the order they appear on the
page.  So, for example, if you forget to type

<P>
<tt>with(linalg);</tt>

<P>
before you start using commands like <tt>matrix</tt>, you can type

<P>
<tt>with(linalg);</tt>

<P>
at the bottom of the page and then go back
up and push RETURN on the commands that failed to run because the
linear algebra package had not been loaded.)

<P>
It is easy to combine two plots into one plot.  Here's an example:

<P>
<PRE>
with(DEtools);
ODE := diff(y(x),x) = y(x)^2 + x^2;
plot1 := dfieldplot( ODE , y(x), x=-1..1, y=-1..1 );
y := rhs( dsolve( { ODE, y(0)=0 } , y(x) ) );
plot2 := plot(y, x=-1..1);
with(plots);
display( {plot1, plot2} );
</PRE>


<P>
Here is another handy feature of the online maple help.   Let's say you
want to differentiate a function, but you don't know the name of the command
to use.  You might guess that there is a differentiate command in maple and
that chances are it begins with <tt>di</tt>.  Type

<P>
<PRE>
?di
</PRE>

<P>
at a maple prompt.  A window will pop up with all the commands in maple
that begin with di.  You'll see a <tt>diff</tt> in the list and that is
the best bet.  Click on it and you'll get a full description of the diff
command we used above.  Scroll down to near the bottom to see a bunch of
examples.

<P>
It is easy to investigate the convergence of a series.  Try these.

<P>
<PRE>
pts := [seq( [ n , evalf(Sum(1/(k^3*sin(k)^2),k=1..n))], n=1..400)]:
plot(pts, style=point);
</PRE>

<P>
(Something funny happens at 355 because 355/113 is very close to pi.)

<P>
Here are some graphing commands that come in handy:

<P>
<PRE>
with(plots):
implicitplot( x^2/9 + y^2/4 = 1 , x=-4..4, y=-3..3 );

plot( [3*cos(t),2*sin(t), t=0..2*Pi] );

p1 := plot( [3*cosh(t),2*sinh(t), t=-2..2] , [-3*cosh(t),2*sinh(t), t=-2..2], color=red ):
p2 := plot( { (2/3)*x, -(2/3)*x } , x=-11..11 ):
display( {p1,p2} );
</PRE>

<P>
Here are some old Maple assignments from MATH 266. Try some of them.

NOTE: The demo's above were created in Maple, then saved as
PostScript files, then converted to PDF files for display on
the web.  This process is rather easy.  I explain the details
of how to do this in
