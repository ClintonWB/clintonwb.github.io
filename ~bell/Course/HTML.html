<H2>How to make your own Home Page on math.purdue.edu</H2><BR>

<p>
<B>Step by step intructions.</B>

<p>
You will need to copy some files called HTML documents as described below and 
store them in a subdirectory named <tt>WWW</tt> under your home directory.

<P>
Your math account should have been created with a <tt>WWW</tt>
subdirectory in your home directory.  To see if it is there, type

<P>
<PRE>
cd
ls
</PRE>

<p>If it is not there, follow these steps to create a WWW directory for
your home page:

<ul>
<li>First make your home directory world-executable.  Use the commands:<br>
<code>cd<br>
chmod go+x ~</code>
<li>Create a subdirectory under your home directory and name it
<tt>WWW</tt>.  Use the command:<br>
<code>mkdir ~/WWW</code>
<li>Make your <tt>WWW</tt> subdirectory world-readable and world-executable.
Use the command:<br>
<code>chmod go+rx ~/WWW</code>
<li>Your HTML files will go in your <tt>WWW</tt> subdirectory as
expllained below.
</ul>

<P>
NOTE: Your <tt>~/WWW</tt> directory MUST be world-executable and
world-readable and your home directory "<tt>~</tt>" must be world-executable.

<p>When someone tries to open your personal <tt>WWW</tt> directory,
the server looks for the file <cite>index.html</cite> (or
<cite>Welcome.html</cite> in the old days, and this will still work).

<p>Every document you place in the World Wide Web
<strong>must</strong> be world-readable.  Run the command:
<P>
<tt>chmod go+r file</tt>
<P>
on each file in your WWW directory that you want the world to be
able to read.

<p>The information you put into your personal home page will be
displayed whenever someone tries to open the unique Universal Resource
Locator (URL) for your account.  The URL for your home page is of the
form:

<p><address>http://www.math.purdue.edu/~YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID</address>

<p>where <i>YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID</i> is your login id.
For example, the URL for the account named <i>bell</i> is

<p><address>http://www.math.purdue.edu/~bell</address>

<p>
I shall now give step by step instructions on how
to set up your <tt>index.html</tt> file and other html files.

<P>
After you have verified that you have a directory called WWW
in your Home Directory, type

<P>
<PRE>
cd
cd WWW
</PRE>

<P>
in an xterm window.  Next, type

<P>
<PRE>
ls -l
</PRE>

<P>
You might see a <tt>Welcome.html</tt> file listed.  That file is
not really there.  It is a link to a dumby file that indicates
that you have not installed your own home page file.  Before you can
install your own files, you must remove this link.  Do this by
typing

<P>
<PRE>
rm Welcome.html
</PRE>

<P>
and answer <tt>y</tt> for YES if you are asked if you really want to.

<P>
Now, while you are still in your WWW directory, (VERY CAREFULLY) type

<P>
<PRE>
cp ~bell/pub/*.html .
cp ~bell/pub/practice1 .
finger $USER > finger
chmod og+r *
</PRE>

<P>
If you want to see what these files will look like as elements of
your Home Page, you can view them at

<P>
<A HREF="http://www.math.purdue.edu/~bell/Course/files.html">
http://www.math.purdue.edu/~bell/Course/files.html</A>

<P>
Many of the photos on the wall outside the Main Office have been
scanned into jpeg files.  If your login id is <tt>myloginid</tt> and
you have been here for many years before 1999, then you should see
yourself if you go to the URL

<P>
<tt>
http://www.math.purdue.edu/images/people/myloginid.jpg
</tt>

<P>
You can copy your image file to your account by typing

<P>
<PRE>
cp /pkgs/www/htdocs/images/people/myloginid.jpg  ~/WWW/photo.jpg
</PRE>

<P>
You can view the picture on a math dept SUN by typing

<P>
<tt>xv photo.jpg &</tt>

<P>
If the image is rotated and way too big, just right mouse click
on the picture in xv.  An xv control window should pop up.  First
click on the rotate button near the bottom to make the picture
right side up.  Then select HALF SIZE from the IMAGE SIZE menu
near the upper right corner of the box.  Then click on the SAVE
box and then click on OK.  (It is normal to reduce the quality
by 75%.  This will make the file smaller and easier to load on
the web.)  You can find a more detailed description of how to
use xv in <A HREF="http://www.math.purdue.edu/~wrf/photoalbum.html">
Volume 22</A> of the Network News.

<P>
Remember, you will need to type

<P>
<PRE>
chmod og+r photo.jpg
</PRE>

<p>
to make the file world readable for the web.

<P>
(If you have access to a scanner, you can even use a picture that is
<A HREF="./photo.gif">way too cool</A>.)

<P>
Your home page should now be ready to view.  Start Netscape
and open the URL for your home page (see above).  Edit the
HTML files to change things like YOUR_NAME_HERE to your
name there.

<P>
If Netscape gives you an error message, chances are that your file
permissions have not been set properly.  As mentioned above, your
Home Directory needs to be executable to others.  Your WWW directory
and all its subdirectories need to be executable and readable to
others.  All files in your WWW directory and its subdirectories
need to be readable by others.  You can set these permissions by
typing the following sequence of change mode commands

<PRE>
cd
chmod og+x ~        % make your Home Dir execuatble to others
chmod og+xr ~/WWW   % make WWW executable, readable to others
cd WWW              % cd to WWW from your Home Directory
chmod og+r *        % make all files, directorys in WWW readable
</PRE>

<P>
To learn more about UNIX file permissions, see
<A HREF="../nn/filemodes">UNIX file modes</A>.

<P>
To learn more about setting up fancier stuff, use Netscape to
look at a nice page and select "View Source" from the VIEW menu
to see how the page is set up.

<P>
It is rather easy to dispaly TeX'ed output on the web.  For
information, see

<P>
<A HREF="../nn/news2.html">
http://www.math.purdue.edu/~bell/nn/news2.html</A>

<P>
One last tidbit.  As you modify and improve your Home Page, you
can see the effect of changes as you make them by viewing the
page in Netscape and by selecting "Reload" from the VIEW
menu after each change.

<h2><a name="About HTML">How to write HTML:</a></h2>

<P>
The HTML language is easy.  To see a summary of the meanings
of HTML tags, click <A HREF="../html_summary">HERE.</A>

<p>
For a more thorough explanation of HTML, see
<a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Internet/WWW/HTMLPrimer.html">
<cite>A Beginner's Guide to HTML</cite></a>.

<p>
Another common question: What editor should I use to write HTML?
Since HTML is a markup language, any generic text editor will work nicely.
For example, this document was written using vi.  See this
<A HREF="./pico.html">pico tutorial</A> for a demonstration on how
to use the very simple pico editor.

Have fun, but try not to get too carried away.
