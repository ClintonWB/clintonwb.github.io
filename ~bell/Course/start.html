To read about the new improved easier method for getting an X-connection
to the Math SUNs from a ITaP PC,

<P>
<H1>
please click <A HREF="../nn/PUCC">HERE</A>.
</H1>

<P>
The new way uses a secure ssh connection and Hummingbird Exceed.
(I also explain how to get these programs for your home PC.)

<P>
What follows is the old way to do this using PC-Xware.  It is 
buggy and insecure.  I do not recommend it.

Setting up an X-connection to MATH from a ITaP PC using PC-Xware
</H3>

<P>
I explain here how to turn a ITaP PC into a Math Dept SUN Ultra --
the only difference will be that the ITaP PC keyboard doesn't have
a coating of sticky dirt on it.

<P>
This guide assumes PC-Xware is installed on the ITaP PC (MS Windows)
machine in front of you.

<P>
First, you must gain access to the PC by loging on with your
Purdue Career Account login ID and password.  If you do not
have these, or you forgot what they are, go to the ITaP office
at MATH 231 for help or get them from the information desk at the
lab you are in.  You might even be able to swipe your Purdue ID
card on the card reader at the top of the keyboard of a machine
in the lab if they are equipped with them.  (Or you can login
with your <tt>ph</tt> alias and password if you know them.)

<P>
After a few seconds, the Windows desktop will appear.

<P>
If the only thing you need to do is to check your e-mail on
your math account, then you will want to simply open a telnet
session to <tt>peano.math.purdue.edu</tt>.  See
<A HREF="./telnet.html">telnetting to math from a ITaP PC</A>.

<P>
If you want to run programs on math that create special windows
or graphics from a ITaP PC (like <tt>xdvi, ghostview,
xfig, xv, acroread, emacs, xedit, xmh,</tt> etc.), you
will want to run these programs from an xterm to math.

<Strong>Setting up a PC-Xware session to math using XDM</strong>

<P>
<ol type="1">
<li>Select Start > Standard Software > Telecommnications...<br>
 ...> NCD PC-Xware > PC-Xware Connection Wizard
<li>Select the third option, "Begin an X session managed by a remort host (XDM)" > Next
<li>Select "Connect to a specific host (XDM Query)" > Next
<li>Select "Specify" ... and enter the host
<tt>peano.math.purdue.edu</tt> > Next
<li>Enter a session name, such as <tt>math</tt> and select "Finish"
</ol>

<P>
Your session will appear in the list of sessions the PC-Xware knows
about.

<P>
Now you can start an XDM session by double clicking on the XDM math icon
in the Connects window.

<P>
To save the configuration in your ITaP Career Account for
future use (and this is a good idea), RIGHT CLICK on the icon and
select copy.  From the Start menu, open Windows Explorer and select
the H: drive.  Paste the math PC-Xware session icon in your H: drive.
You may now launch a PC-Xware session in a ITaP PC lab from your ITaP
Career Account by double clicking on the icon in your career account.

<P>
NOTE 1. You will have to repeat all the steps above every time you log in
to a ITaP PC unless you copy the math session icon to your career
account.

<P>
NOTE 2. When you log out from a connection, the X server does not
exit until you shut it down.  First type "exit" in your first xterm
window.  Next, click and hold on the "Shutdown" button in the little
box and then choose "Immediately."  Finally, terminate the X server
by clicking on the little "television" icon next to the clock on the
main menu bar and sellecting "terminate." (You should always do this
last step before logging off the PC.)<br>

<P>
NOTE 3. If you iconify the XDM session and then select the PC-Xware
screen from the MS Windows task bar, the MS Windows task bar is not
visible, press Control-ESC to view the MS Windows task bar OR move
the X window until a small part of the MS Windows desktop shows on the
left or right side.	

<P>
If everything comes up way to big, you might try setting the screen resolution
on the PC to the maximum allowable setting.  (Do this by clicking on the "My
computer" icon, then the "Control Panel" icon, then the "Display"
icon, then click on "Settings" and pull the resolution adjustment arrow
all the way to the right.  Then click on "Apply.")

<P>

<P>
<Strong>To modify the properties of connections you have created:</strong>
<ol type="1">
<li>Start > Programs > NCD PC-Xware > PC-Xware Connections
<li>Right click the icon of the connection to be modified and select "Properties".
<li>Select the Connection Tab  and Change Properties...
</ol>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
You can switch back and forth between various programs by
clicking on the icons at the top of the screen.  For
example, it you click on the netscape icon, the netscape
window will come to the foreground and the math window will
be behind it.  To get the math window back in front, just click
on the math box at the top of the screen.

<P>
If you find the font in the math xterm window too small or too
large, you can change it by positioning the mouse
inside the xterm window and holding down the CONTROL key while
pushing the right mouse button.  Select a different sized font
from the menu by releasing the right mouse button at the
appropriate menu item.  (Another nice thing to know is that you
can simulate a MIDDLE MOUSE button push on a SUN mouse by pushing
both mouse buttons at the same time on the PC.)

<P>
If you find the magnification in an <tt>xdvi</tt> window too small or too
large, you can change it by typing <tt>s4</tt> in the window.  Try
different positive integers after the <tt>s</tt> until you like
what you see.

<P>
You can run commands on math from the ITaP PC.  For example,
to run xmaple, type

<P>
<tt>
xmaple &
</tt>

<P>
(The ampersand "&" puts the xmaple job in the "background" so that
you can continue to type commands in the xterm window while xmaple
is running.) The xmaple graphics windows will appear on the screen
of your ITaP PC in a few seconds exactly as they would on a math
machine console.

<P>
To run matlab, you would type

<P>
<tt>
matlab
</tt>

<P>
without an ampersand at the end.

<P>
Even though it is easy to run Maple and Matlab from a math xterm,
we recommend that you run Maple and Matlab locally on a ITaP PC.

<P>
HELPFUL HINT:  Holding down the left and right mouse buttons at the
same time on a ITaP PC simulates pushing the middle mouse button on
a SUN mouse.
