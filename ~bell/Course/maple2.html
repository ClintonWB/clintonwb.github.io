How to use Maple as a technical
word processor for the web
</H1>

<P>
Here is an example of a

<P>
<A HREF="./example.pdf">MAPLE worksheet converted to PDF format</A>

<P>
for display on the web that you can easily create using maple and the
<tt>distill</tt> command.

<P>
I shall now give step by step instructions on how I created such a thing.

<P>
First, start maple on a math dept SUN and <EM>unselect</EM>

<P>
<PRE>
Show Section Ranges
Show Group Ranges
</PRE>

<P>
in case they have been selected by default.

<P>
Next, click on the INSERT menu and select TEXT INPUT.

<P>
Type in something like

<P>
<HR>

<P>
<PRE>
MATH 262 Homework Set 1

1. Show that
</PRE>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
Push RETURN a couple of times and then click on the INSERT menu
again and select MAPLE INPUT.  Type

<P>
<PRE>
Int( x^2*sin(x) , x ) = int( x^2*sin(x) , x ) + C;
</PRE>

<P>
at the maple prompt and push RETURN.

<P>
Next, left mouse click and drag over the MAPLE INPUT that you just
typed, being careful not to highlight the output.  (Or you can
triple left mouse click on the line to highlight it.)  Now select
CUT from the EDIT menue and the maple input is gone, leaving just
the output.

<P>
Next, left mouse click below the maple output and choose
TEXT INPUT from the INSERT menu and type

<P>
<HR>

<P>
<PRE>
in three different ways.

2.  Find a second order linear ordinary differential equation
     with integer coefficients whose solution most resembles
</PRE>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
and push RETURN a couple of times and then click on the INSERT menu
again and select MAPLE INPUT.  Type

<P>
<PRE>
plot( exp(-x)*sin(3*x) , x=0..3 );
</PRE>

<P>
and push RETURN.  Next, triple left mouse click on the maple input
line to highlight it and select CUT from the EDIT menue and the maple
input is gone, leaving just the graphical output.

<P>
When the worksheet looks just the way you want it, select PRINT from
the FILE menu and select OUTPUT TO FILE in the dialogue box that pops
up and type a name like

<P>
<tt>
homework1.ps
</tt>

<P>
in the OUTPUT TO FILE window.  Click on PRINT at the bottom of the
dialogue window.

<P>
Now you can quit MAPLE and you will find a file called
<tt>homework1.ps</tt> in the directory in which you started maple.

<P>
Next, type

<P>
<PRE>
distill homework1.ps
</PRE>

<P>
This will create a file called <tt>homework1.pdf</tt> suitable for
putting on the web.  To create a link like the one I made at the top
of this page to display my PDF file, just add lines like this
